Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-19T20:18:56.726739285Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have Docker installed already, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nNow that you are happy with how your Quartz instance looks, let's get it hosted!\n\n\u003e 🌍 Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-19T20:18:56.730739318Z","tags":null},"/notes/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.

If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat! Now you have everything you need to start editing and growing your digital garden.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2023-01-19T20:18:56.730739318Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?

Czyli rzeczy, które mi zostały w głowie i którymi chce się w razie czego sam ze sobą podzielić.\n\n1.  Skonfiguruj swój telefon, aby korzystać z niego lepiej - Artykuł zaskoczył mnie tym, że w tym temacie wciąż są proste rzeczy do zmieniania. Pisałem już o tym, [żeby zmieniać swój telefon tak, żeby był mniej atrakcyjny](https://niecodzienny.net/2017/12/zwracasz-uwage-trzymasz-zasiegu-reki/) i wszyscy uważają mnie w tej kwestii za hardcore’a („czemu Twój telefon jest czarno-biały”? Ekran Ci się zepsuł?). A tu ([https://medium.com/better-humans/how-to-set-up-your-iphone-for-productivity-focus-and-your-own-longevity-bb27a68cc3d8#c11d](https://medium.com/better-humans/how-to-set-up-your-iphone-for-productivity-focus-and-your-own-longevity-bb27a68cc3d8#c11d)) znalazłem kilka innych ciekawych rzeczy. Od prościutkich - zmień nazwę telefonu, do absurdalnych (ale tym bardziej kuszących) - wyłącz trwale Safari. I dowolną inną przeglądarkę. Oookej, let’s take it for a spin.  \n      \n    Zwróćcie też uwagę na wzmiankę o tym, jak zmienia się zachowanie wobec „wirtualnego asystenta” kiedy jest głosem kobiecym i męskim. [[wit o świadomym korzystaniu]], [[eksperymenty]]\n2.  Jakoś tak się złożyło, że kilka dni temu postanowiłem zmierzyć się z pomysłami [[Tim Ferriss]]a i… to co testuję, to pisanie / pracowanie przy jednym zapętlonym kawałku. Czemu tak? Bo to ma być wyciszające a nie angażujące. Cały czas jeszcze szukam tego kawałka, który będzie moim tłem, ale… [próbujemy z Gramatikiem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxKnO9GzgQM) i myślę że się lubimy. Swoją drogą, zamierzam zapoznać się z newsletterem Tima Ferrissa (5 bullet friday) i… zobaczymy co to przyniesie. Ciekawie otwiera na nowe. [[eksperymenty]]\n3.  Jeszcze w temacie Ferrissa, bardzo przyjemnie słuchało się jego [rozmowy z Jamie Foxx’em](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGnnEfmP8K4), choć to zasługa głównie tego, co miał do powiedzenia Foxx, a nie to co od siebie dodawał Ferriss. Nadstawianie mikrofonu to może być zwyczajnie za mało. [[Tim Ferriss]]\n4.  Mam (przynajmniej na moment w którym to piszę) głód pisania. I postanowienie - wygospodaruj na to czas. Na pisanie. Do siebie, dla siebie. Rzeczy, które mogą być dziennikiem, ale wcale nie muszą. Znajdź formułę, a nie chowaj się za tym, ze nie masz formuły. Spróbuj. To nie gryzie.  [[wit o pisaniu]]\n5.  Chce więcej czytać. Chcę eksperymentować z czytaniem. Z szybkim czytaniem, z czytaniem regularnym. Z czytaniem jednej książki w tygodniu. Nie chodzi o wyżyłowanie się i mienie do siebie pretensji. Spróbujmy po prostu brać co tydzień jakąś książkę i próbować w nią wchodzić. Nie ścigam się z nikim. Skoro umiem znaleźć czas na ćwiczenia (codzienne) to czemu miałbym nie znaleźć na to czasu. To moja decyzja. Granie w gry jest spoko (nawet jeśli jestem absolutną lamą). Seriale bywają spoko (ale miej proporcje mocium panie), ogarnij się i czytaj. Tym bardziej, że masz jeszcze kilka godzin podróży w tygodniu, przynajmniej jeszcze przez kilka tygodni. [[eksperymenty]]\n6.  Wciąż jestem jeszcze przed planowaniem 2020 (tak, wiem, zaczął się kilka dni temu). Założenie jest takie, żeby wykorzystać na to lepiej przyszły tydzień. Na ten moment jestem jeszcze bardzo wcześnie w fazie podsumowywania tego co działo się w poprzednim roku. [[wit o planowaniu]] \n7.  Cytat, który mi w głowie trochę siedzi. Autorem Scott Galloway (coś czuję, że jego będzie dużo w moich tygodniówkach)\n\n![](https://i2.wp.com/niecodzienny.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/networks.jpg?fit=560%2C166\u0026ssl=1)\n\n[[Scott Galloway]], FckdEx\n\nDziki jest ten świat. \n\n8.  Książka skończona w tym tygodniu - [Choice Factory, Richard Shotton](https://www.amazon.com/Choice-Factory-behavioural-biases-influence/dp/085719609X) - rzecz o zachowaniach społecznych, przekonaniach i nudge’ach jakie można wykorzystać przygotowując komunikację, a chcąc przekonać odbiorcę do działania, m.in pozytywny i negatywny społeczny dowód zaufania, ból ponoszonego kosztu, klątwa wiedzy... mam wrażenie, że dużo już z tego znam, a równocześnie zaraz po przeczytaniu mam przekonanie, że muszę jeszcze raz przez tą książkę przejść, bo czytanie rozwlekłem tak bardzo, że niewiele z niej pamietam. [[książki]] [[Choice Factory]] [[jak myślą ludzie]]\n9.  Ważne - [[Choice Factory]] posiada także ciekawy zbiór książek, o tym jak podejmujemy decyzje i jak dokonujemy wyborów. [[książki]], \n10.  Trochę w nawiązaniu do wspomnianej książki, a także do fragmentu podcastu Recode-Decode i rozmowy [[Kara Swisher]] z [[David Epstein]] - anegdotki są super, ale to zbyt często zbyt uproszczone przedstawienie rzeczywistości. Bystander Effect, na podstawie morderstwa w Nowym Jorku o tym, jak to znieczulica sprawiła, że mimo 37(lub 38) świadków zdarzenia, nikt nie zareagował na dźganie kobiety - trzy osoby zareagowały, ale to się pomija. Epstein z kolei kwestionuje regułę 10 tysięcy godzin wobec istoty naturalnych predyspozycji i... pewnie coś w tym jest, tzn predyspozycje ułatwiają wejście w jakiś temat, co sprawia, że wysiłek potrzebny do osiągnięcia efektu jest inny (lub inaczej odbierany). Istotą jest jednak, aby nie przyjmować łatwych rozwiązań jako leku na całe zło. Zapewne nie jest to tak piękne, ani jednoznaczne, ani efektywne jak o tym mówią, tylko mało kto to sprawdza. [[upraszczanie]], [[jak korzystać z wiedzy]]\n11.  Swoją drogą, jestem cholernie ciekaw jakie firmy w Polsce maja działy marketingu, które pozwalają sobie na eksperymentowanie i szukanie takich komunikacyjnych „sztuczek”... [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n12.  Istota wartości. Czytałem - [For goodness sex](https://www.amazon.com/Goodness-Sex-Changing-Sexuality-Values/dp/0062269518/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=for+goodness+sex\u0026qid=1578644657\u0026s=books\u0026sr=1-1) i tam stoi mocno napisane - zanim porozmawiamy o seksie, porozmawiajmy o wartościach. Twoich i Twojego domu. Teraz czytam How to stop procrastinating i tam stoi jak byk zanim dam Ci rady, jak przestać przekładać rzeczy na później, [[porozmawiajmy o wartościach]]. Wychodzi na to, ze ta rozkmina mnie nie ominie  [[książki]]\n13.  Książka skończona w pociągu - [How to stop procrastinating - S.J. Scott](https://www.amazon.com/How-Stop-Procrastinating-Mastering-Procrastination-ebook/dp/B0742KRKDG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3P6QR3A54EBSJ\u0026keywords=how+to+stop+procrastinating\u0026qid=1578644690\u0026s=books\u0026sprefix=how+to+stop+pro%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C274\u0026sr=1-1). Brzmi to troszkę tak, jakbym się próbował brać za bary ze swoim poważnym mankamentem... cóż, nie łudzę się, nie mam ambicji zostania mistrzem efektywności, ale mam ochotę spróbować paru technik, które wyczytałem. Ciut więcej świadomości w działaniu, troszkę więcej świadomego decydowania, próba  korzystania z Pomodoro, może nutka planowania... dużo zmian, co niesie ze sobą spore ryzyko niepowodzenia. Jest zapał, jest ciekawość, jest świadomość ryzyka i tego, że nie będzie kolorowo, ani łatwo. Zobaczymy, co będzie. Ważne, żebym zrobił ćwiczenia, które są w książce. [[eksperymenty]], [[pomodoro]], [[wit o prokrastynacji]]\n14.  Mam w zwyczaju organizować raz do roku spotkanie dla bliskich i troszkę dalszych znajomych, zabieram ich do kina na seans, który sam dla nich wybieram, taka mała tradycja, która trwa już 15 lat. Ten dzień i wieczór przynosi wiele dobrych emocji i wiele przyjemności, niestety jest poprzedzony całkiem spora dawką wiadomości, które rozpoczynają się od słów „Wit bardzo mi przykro, ale...”. I doskonale rozumiem powody, równocześnie za każdym razem jest to gorzka pigułka. Na całe szczęście, całkiem spora grupa dociera, czyniąc - jak wspomniałem, ten wieczór wyjątkowym. Ale i tak strach czasem odbierać telefon. [[wit o rzeczywistości]], [[urodziny]]\n15.  Wiedziałem, że mam fetysz kubkowy - są kubki z których lubię pić i takie, które w jakiś przedziwny sposób w dotyku robią mi meeeh. Wszyscy mamy swoje dziwactwa. To czego nie wiedziałem, to to, że mam także fetysz ołówka. A dokładniej, fetysz zastruganego ołówka. Wydawało mi się, że ołówek jest ołówek, i zaostrzony jest zaostrzony. No rocket science. Aż do czasu, kiedy trafiła mi się zastrugaczka (po krakowsku), temperówka (ogólnopolskie) oszczytko/ostrzytko (po poznańsku) które ostrzyło jakoś tak… bardziej przysadziście. Niby wszystko ok, ale był w tym jakiś przedziwny dyskomfort. Myślałem że to złuda, ale kilka dni później zaostrzyłem ponownie i znowu wrażenie - wszystko gra aaaale,  jednak nie. Zmieniłem zastrugaczkę i… wszystko wróciło do normy, głowa się uspokoiła. Tak. Mam fetysz zastruganego ołówka. [[dziwadełka]]\n\nTak wygląda mój mind dump z pierwszego tygodnia.

Uważam, że to jest [skubanie po złotówce](https://niecodzienny.net/2017/10/moda-abonament-czyli-skubanie-zlotowce/). I nie rzecz w tym, że to zło z założenia, ale mam wrażenie, że ostatnio wszyscy oszaleli na tym punkcie i robią co mogą, aby rozwiązanie jednorazowej płatności zamienić na płatność wielorazową. Irytujące jest to (moim zdaniem) zwłaszcza w przypadku oprogramowania. Niektóre firmy DTC (direct to customer) próbuja przejść na ten model relacji z klientem, gdyż jest on dobrym zabezpieczeniem - pozwala przewidzieć ile towaru będziemy potrzebować, jaki wpływ mamy mniej więcej zagwarantowany. Co prawda, czasem to też jest fikcja (million dolar shave club wygląda bardzo ładnie, ale to chyba była wydmuszka zrobiona specjalnie dla Gillette). Słyszeliście o abonamencie do kawiarni?

Kiedy wszyscy zachwycają się marketingiem Pornhubu (choćby jego ostatnią otwartością premium dla Włoch), ja zaczynam mieć z nim problem. A równocześnie, to trochę problem ze sobą samym.

O tym się nie mówi, to się ogląda w ciemności, to się ogląda pokątnie i po kątach. Ale się ogląda. Ja oglądam (to jest mój coming out). Ja lubię. Nie w nadmiarze (chyba) ale... oglądam. Także na pornhubie, który jest taki fajny, taki współczesny, taki marketingowy, że niemal lajfstajlowy. To pierwszy problem.   \n      \n    Pornografia to nie lajfstajl. Podobnie jak Mission Impossible nie jest Twoim (moim) codziennym dniem w pracy. Ani Dexter. Ani nawet Klan. A już na pewno nie \"Moda na sukces\". Nie i już.Druga rzecz, to to, że jestem przyzwyczajony do tego, że oglądając coś na Youtube, albo na Netflixie, albo na HBO to widząc obsadę wiem, że ludzie biorący udział w tym przedsięwzięciu, zrobili to świadomie i wyrazili na to świadomą zgodę. I przenoszę domniemanie tej zgody także na pornhuba. Jakbym nigdy w życiu nie słyszał o kobietach zmuszanych do seksu i prostytucji.   \n      \n    Czy świadomie oglądałem film z kimś kto był do seksu zmuszony? Nie. Czy mam absolutną pewność, że ludzie których oglądałem wyrazili na to obopólną zgodę... no... nie. Czy dla mnie to jest spoko? Nie. Także przy najlepszym marketingu świata, chyba jednak muszę przemodelować swoje zachowanie. Bo taki jest problem z pornhubem; [https://traffickinghub.com](https://traffickinghub.com/) \n4.

Z czym by innym.\n\n1.  Staram się być możliwie spokojny. Bez świrowania. Bez czytania czego popadnie. Bez snucia wniosków o rzeczach, na których się nie znam. Bez nakręcania paniki. Bez dzielenia się tym, co ktoś gdzieś usłyszał, a co zawsze jest pewną informacją od znajomego znajomego z ministerstwa. To nakręca panikę. Przy wszystkich zastosowanych działaniach, nie jest mi łatwo. A uważam się za rozsądnego człowieka. [[wit o rzeczywistości]], [[Koronawirus]]\n2.

Co też ciekawego mnie złapało w tym tygodniu\n\n1.  Początki mierzenia się z prokrastynację nie są łatwe. Na razie jestem na etapie zwiększania własnej świadomości co mi czas kradnie i jak bardzo nie umiem sobie z tym poradzić. Potrzebuję determinacji do tego, żeby zamykać głowę na czas i nie pozwalać jej uciekać za bardzo. Będzie ćwiczone. Bez paniki. Krok po kroku. Trzeba się pilnować. I wyłączyć powiadomienia większości aplikacji. Nic osobistego, po prostu krzycząc odwracają uwagę. Niepotrzebnie. Niby już poograniczałem, ale nie dość.  \n2.  Pierwszy kontakt z metodą Pomodoro (ustaw sobie okresy 25 minut na pracę + 5 minut przerwy) zaskakująco… przyjemne. I zdaje się efektywne. I… mam nadzieję, coś z tego będzie. Korzystam z aplikacji „Be Focused” ( [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/be-focused-focus-timer/id973134470](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/be-focused-focus-timer/id973134470) ) - łatwa, prosta, wygodna. No cholera chyba się polubimy.\n3.  Łatwiej mi było z metodą Pomodoro w domu (home office) niż w biurze. Troszkę dlatego, że łatwiej było się wyłączyć na określony czas od bodźców. Siedząc za firmowym biurkiem zdarzało się nie raz, że ktoś podszedł, podpytał, wytrącił z tego w czym w danym momencie byłem głową. Muszę nauczyć się mówić „przepraszam, za moment”. To w sumie coś, o czym pisano w „one second head” - to Ty decydujesz, kiedy i komu poświęcisz swoją uwagę. Naucz się świadomie odmawiać. \n4.  Ostatnia myśl związana z Pomodoro… Tu jak w medytacji. Od czasu do czasu, coś sprawi, że Twoje skupienie związane z oddechem i niemyśleniem o niczym zostanie przerwane i pomkniesz uwagą za jakimś mniej lub bardziej ważnym skojarzeniem. Właśnie wtedy powinieneś „gently, but firmly” sprowadzić uwagę do tego, na czym Ty chcesz ją skupić. Bez krytyki, bez żalu, ale z pewnym wysiłkiem wrócić głową w miejsce, w którym w danym momencie chcesz ją mieć. I to samo zauważam przy pracowym rozproszeniu. Moje rozwiązanie? Zauważam, a następnie wykonuje pewien wysiłek aby wrócić na chciane tory. Ćwiczymy. Pierwsze efekty są malutkie, ale dają nadzieję.   \n5.  Just Jammin Gramatika ([wspominałem w zeszłym tygodniu](https://niecodzienny.net/2020/01/czy-w-2020-bede-pisal-wiecej-moze/)) zapętlony w tle nadal się sprawdza. Zobaczymy jak długo. Nie chciałbym sobie obrzydzić tego kawałka.\n6.  Finowie udostępnili darmowy kurs o podstawach sztucznej inteligencji. Brzmi interesująco, chyba się skusze. [https://www.elementsofai.com/](https://www.elementsofai.com/) \n7.  Cytat, który zwrócił moją uwagę: „Point of view is worth 80 IQ points” - Alan Key, z książki The Everything Store.\n8.  Ze specjalną dedykacja dla pana Prezydenta Kochanego naszego „Jeśli jesteś pochodzenia europejskiego albo azjatyckiego, istnieje duża szansa, w przedziale od jednego do czterech procent, ze masz neandertalskie DNA” - Ludzie, krótka historia o tym, jak spieprzylismy wszystko, Tom Philips. I równocześnie dygresja... im więcej czytasz, tym więcej masz treści, do której możesz się odnieść. Swoją droga, im więcej czytasz, tym częściej trafiasz na podobne argumenty (co sprawia ze a - może jednak tych argumentów jest skończona ilość, b - jest szansa ze lepiej je zapamiętasz). Tym razem o roli kotwiczenia w percepcji rzeczywistości (por. Choice Factory).\n9.  Droga rzeczywistości, podpowiadacz mi te książkę - Thinking Fast and słów - trzeci raz w ciągu miesiąca.

Może i wygodne, ale średnio efektywne.\n12.  Na listę książek do przeczytania, a może raczej do sprawdzenia czy na te listę trafi pozycja Davida Epsteina - Range, why generalists triumph in specialised world. Wszystko na podstawie wspomnianej rozmowy na Recode Decode. Ale większa pokusa jest tez sprawdzenie co ten człowiek. napisał, bo mówi bardzo ciekawie.\n13.  Od kilku tygodni jestem posiadaczem AirPodsów. Wszystko dlatego, że kolejne Earpodsy postanowiły zakończyć (albo prawie zakończyć) swój żywot, losowo puszczając muzykę / podcast kiedy nie miałem na to ochoty. Na moje (absolutnie) niewymagające ucho, słuchawki od Apple robią robotę - dźwięk, jakość wykonanie, cena - wszytko gra. Dlatego postanowiłem spróbować wersji bezkabelkowej. Wrażenia… są tak samo wygodne, ładowanie (dzięki case’owi) nie stanowi problemu, trzeba uważać, bo potrafią wypaść z ucha w najmniej spodziewanym momencie, mikrofon chyba zbiera zbyt dużo dźwięków z otoczenia, ale też może to być konsekwencja tego, że lubię słuchać na jednym uchu… O ile w zamkniętej, cichej przestrzeni nie ma z tym problemów, o tyle na ulicy to rozwiązanie się nie sprawdza. Muszę przekonać się czy używanie obu słuchawek rozwiązuje ten problem.\n14.  Druga uwaga do Airpodsów - zapomniałem jak wygodne jest korzystanie z pilota na słuchawkach - bez sięgania do telefonu zmiana głośności, szybkie przewijanie (reklam w podcastach). No cóż, tego AirPods (gen1) nie oferują. Ale można to robić via Siri. Tylko czy ja chcę / umiem / polubię podgłaśnianie przez Siri… Trzeba się będzie przekonać.\n15.  W ramach ciekawostek, a zdaje sie mało kto o tym wie, zachęcam do podglądnięcia \"ważnych miejsc\" jakie w ramach danych lokalizacyjnych gromadzi iOS (Ustawienia -\u003e prywatność -\u003e usługi lokalizacji -\u003e usługi systemowe -\u003e ważne miejsca). Można sobie całkiem sporo powspominać 　 Ciekawe czemu ukryli to tak głęboko... i tak, można to zdezaktywować. Albo przynamniej poczuć się lepiej nie widząc, że te dane są gromadzone.\n16.  I w sumie jeszcze jedna dziwna refleksja o iOSie i „mądrości” tego systemu. Słownik - działa spoko, o ile zrobisz jedną literówkę w słowie. Zrobisz dwie i dokonuje się Panic kernel, czyli nie ma bata, aby podpowiedział co chciałeś napisać. Polska język trudna język. \n17.  Lubię Penna Jillette. Dawno temu wydawał mi się głośnym amerykańskim komikiem, który umie w iluzję. Potem okazało się, że jest świetnym amerykańskim iluzjonistą, umiejącym w humor. Potem okazało się, że jest sceptykiem, ateistą i że lubi zaszczepiać zdroworozsądkowe podejście do świata (poszukaj BullSh!t), a potem okazało się, że gość też świetnie pisze i „przez niego” [wywróci mi się cały sposób w jaki się odżywiam, zgubię i nie odzyskam (przez jak na razie 2 lata) ponad 10kg](https://niecodzienny.net/2017/12/13-rzeczy-ktorych-nigdy-sadzilem-ze-zrobie/). Więc, joke’s on me, i nadal lubię Penna Jillette. Kiedy więc okazało się, że Ferriss (wobec którego jestem sceptyczny) [nagrał 2h rozmowę z nim](https://tim.blog/2020/01/09/penn-jillette/), wiedziałem, że będę musiał jej posłuchać. Jednym z początkowych wątków tej rozmowy jest prowadzenie dziennika (na które nie mam, nigdy nie miałem ochoty. Nie Codzienny w tytule jest tu pewnego rodzaju podpowiedzią. Aaaale, Penn opisał swój rytuał porannego pisania, który obejmuje także „codzienne czytanie historii, czyli tego co napisał rok, 10 lat temu i 20 lat temu”. I dopowiedział, że to trochę jak podróż w czasie i rozmawianie z samym sobą z przeszłości i... wiesz co chłopie, jak mało kto potrafisz złożyć obietnicę. Ostatnim razem kiedy to zrobiłeś, powiedziałeś że nic tak nie smakuje, jak gotowana kukurydza po monodiecie (uwierzyłem Ci, choć nie spróbowałem) i zmieniłeś moją dietę. Tym razem Ci się nie uda. Nie uda Ci się. \n18.  Swoją drogą, już raz przytaczałem na niecodziennym tekst z przed 10 lat. I, prawdę powiedziawszy, bez wstydu. A nawet z małą satysfakcją. Zarówno z treści jaki z formy.\n19.  Jak już jesteśmy przy wypominkach, to tak wygląda tekst napisany mniej więcej 10 lat temu, bo w styczniu 2010. I z jakiegoś powodu jest tam otagowana Beata Kempa. Ta sama, która w tym tygodniu dała popis w Brukseli. No po prostu czad. [Uwłaczający spektakl, uwłaczający aktorzy](https://niecodzienny.net/2010/01/uwlaczajacy-spektakl-uwlaczajacy-aktorzy/)\n20.  Jeszcze jedna rzecz o wywiadzie Penna Jillette. Na koniec rozmowy z Ferrissem, pytany o to, co chciałby dodać, czy jest coś nad czym teraz się zastanawia, powiedział, że biorąc pod uwagę ilość hejtu jaki się wylewa zewsząd w sieci, i widząc że social media zamiast nas łączyć doprowadzają do coraz głębszych podziałów, i będąc przekonanym, że najlepsze są pokojowe rewolucje, zastanawia się, w jaki sposób możemy zejść z tej szkodliwej drogi. I ukuł zwrot, który stosuje, aby unikać podziałów na My i Oni. Podziałów, który jest szkodliwy i konfliktowy. Jilette interesował w szczególności podział na tych, którzy głosowali na Trumpa i na resztę. I pracuje nad tym, aby mówić „Those of us, who voted for Trump”. Genialne. Those of us. Genialne. Biorąc pod uwagę, że [język, którego używamy w polityce, ale w dowolnym innym aspekcie naszej rzeczywistości ma znaczenie](https://niecodzienny.net/2016/03/jezyk-a-polityka/), jest kurcze pod wielkim wrażeniem. Those of us.  \n21.  Anka przypomniała mi film z 9 dobrymi radami od pewnego Austarlijczyka dla młodych ludzi.   \n      \n    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoEezZD71sc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoEezZD71sc)  \n      \n    I sam film znałem, to co mnie wytrąciło, to to, że zaczyna się od od słów - mając 37.9 lat, podzielę się z Wami swoimi obserwacjami. I tu dwa prztyczki w mój pyrkaty (zdaje się wciąż) nos. Po pierwsze, dobre ma te rady. Po drugie, nie wiem, czy ja potrafiłbym znaleźć swoje, tak dobre i tak dobrze podane 9 rad dla młodych. Niemała zazdrość. Duże uznanie.\n22.  Artykuł o serwisie OnlyFans, i jak zmienia się zarabianie na soft (a pewnie i hard) porno. [https://www.1843magazine.com/people/onlyfans-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-topless-creator](https://www.1843magazine.com/people/onlyfans-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-topless-creator) Z tego artykułu dwa cytaty  \n      \n    On any given day, 100m users visit porn sites owned by the company Mindgeek, such as Pornhub, RedTube and YouPorn. As with any industry in decline, as profits crumble, labour rights and pay are affected. Female performers may be paid £300 for a shoot, with another £100 thrown in for extra sex acts. As a result, performers are pushed into performing more hardcore scenes to make money.  \n      \n    This illusion of proximity is critical to OnlyFans’ appeal. “Hardcore porn is easy to come by, but a relationship with a girl is hard to get,” explains Andrew, a 42-year-old engineer from Sheffield. “But with OnlyFans you get it.” He’s been following Brooks since September 2018 and estimates he spends around £300 a month on her page. He believes that Brooks does care for him. “If I go quiet and don’t take part in things for a few days, she notices and will start messaging me and asking me how I am.” I ask Andrew if it feels like he and Brooks are in a relationship. He pauses. “It's difficult to define,” he says finally. “There are times when it feels like we almost are a couple.”\n23.  Książka skończona w tym tygodniu - Ludzie, krótka historia o tym, jak wszystko spieprzyliśmy. Dość posępny, choć napisany lekkim językiem, przegląd małych i dużych porażek ludzkości. No na błędach to my się nie uczymy. Niestety. Przyjemna lektura, choć to zupełnie inny kaliber niż Sapiens. \n24.  Kilka dni temu zobaczyłem taką „checklistę” i mnie zmroziło.

W tym tygodniu nie będzie o samym KoronaWirusie, raczej o tym jakie piętno na naszej (mojej) rzeczywistości odciska. O KoronaWirusie pisze się dużo, bardzo dużo, często błędnie i nadmiar informacji (a często tylko nadmiar słów) nie pomaga. Musimy czekać i zdać się na specjalistów. Fascynuje mnie natomiast to, że najwięcej o tym wirusie mogę dowiedzieć się śledząc dobrze wybranych ludzi na TT albo oglądając wartościowe materiały na YT. To są moje źródła informacji. Przechodząc do tygodniówki... [[wit o rzeczywistości]], [[Koronawirus]]\n2.  Mam wrażenie, że od początku 2020 zapisałem się na więcej newsletterów niż to miało miejsce przez ostatnie 10 lat. I z dużo wiekszą świadomością, przyjemnością i celowością. [Vive le email](https://niecodzienny.net/2017/04/porozmawiajmy-o-emailu/). [[newsletter]]\n3.  Równocześnie teraz się okazuję, że nie mam strategii (joke’s on me) na to, jak sobie z tymi newsletterami poradzić. Cierpię na syndrom „inbox 0” i... teraz sam sobie robię krzywdę, zapisując się do kolejnych. Chyba będzie potrzeba zastosowania jakiejś „rule of thumb”, poprzez ograniczenie tych newsletterów na które mam czas i głowę i tych które będą wyłącznie się gromadzić i kurzyć. Jakieś podpowiedzi, anyone? [[newsletter]]\n4.  Swoją drogą, wydawało mi się, że kiedy będę w domu, moja tygodniówka będzie puchła. Będę czytał więcej, słuchał więcej, ogólnie że będę lepszym człowiekiem. A potem jeszcze pojawił się motyw „Social distancing” i „siedź w domu, dla siebie i dla społeczeńśtwa”, co też powinno oznaczać - masz więcej czasu. Tyle tylko że siedzenie w domu z sześciolatkiem, który też ma dużo czasu (i jeszcze więcej energii), sprawia że moja przestrzeń jest radykalnie przeorganizowywana. I zamiast mieć więcej czasu, mam mniej, trudniejszego w zaplanowaniu czasu (wymówka). Do tego stopnia, że nawet nie wiem, czy jest sens pisać tygodniówkę. Bo ona będzie jeszcze bardziej o „ja ja ja” niż zwykle. [[zarządzanie czasem]], [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]]\n5.  Skoro już siedzimy w domu, to może produktywnie. Wykorzystajmy czas na porządki, także w książkach. Trwa próba zrobienia selekcji książek w domowej bibliotece, które a) będą jeszcze (raz) czytane, b) nie będą czytane, można je dać do ludzi, c) te z którymi nie wiem co zrobić. Najciekawsza jest oczywiście grupa c. Obiecuje sobie poświecić każdej książce z tej grupy 15 minut i ocenić, czy zostaje, czy idzie w świat. [[książki]]\n6.  Na pierwszy ogień poszła króciutka „Szczęście czy fart”, czyli kolejna pozycja z gatunku ocierającego się o kołczowanie. Ale bez indoktrynacji, za to ze zwróceniem uwagi, że szczęście to organizowanie przestrzeni i sprzyjających warunków. Czyta się błyskawicznie, czy zmienia radykalnie pogląd.. nie, raczej przypomina. Zawsze i wszędzie zaczynamy od siebie i pamiętamy o tym, że wiele od nas zależy. Cieszę się, że to przeczytałem. [[książki]], [[jak żyć]], [[ile waży szczęście]]\n7.  Kilka innych książek sprawdzonych i pozostawionych do przeczytania, to „50 minutów psychologii współczesnej”, „jak nakarmić dyktatora”. Ale muszę poczekać, bo na razie cała na biało wjechała [książka o Epidemiach autorstwa Michaela Osterholma](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I1AIU70/ref=pe_385040_117923520_TE_M1DP), którego można posłuchać w przeciekawym wywiadzie u [[Joe Rogan]]a. [[Michael Osterolm]]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw\n\n8.  Cały czas nie umiem ogarnąć, jak to jest, że facet, którego kojarzę głównie z gal UFC przeprowadza tak cholernie ciekawe wywiady. Ameryka to jest jednak niezwykły kraj. A w kwestii epidemii... no nie, nie będę zdradzał zakończenia. W kolejne ustawiłem też Dżumę, Camus. [[opis obyczajów]]\n9.  Porządki objęły także filmy. Druga selekcja. W pierwszej odpadło jakieś 300-400 filmów, w drugiej kolejne 150. Z bólem serca zostawiam / skłonny jestem oddać te filmy, ale... duża część z nich jest dostępna w niektórych streamingach (przynajmniej przez czas / co czas jakiś), ale też łapię się na tym że już nie mam w domu sprzętu, na którym mógłbym te zgromadzone filmy odtworzyć. Na szczęście „na wsi” jeszcze jakiś odtwarzacz DVD jest. Ciekawe czy działa. [[o filmach]]\n10.  Co zostawiłem? M.in. Skyfall, Dziewczynę z Tatuażem, Ojca Chrzestnego, Piratów z Karaibów, Leaving Las Vegas, Wszyscy jesteśmy Chrystusami (którego nadal nie mam odwagi obejrzeć), sześć sezonów West Wing, Pan życia i śmierci, Nolanowa trylogia Batmana... [[o filmach]]\n11.  Apropos sprzętu... Ponieważ jest kryzys, to kminie nad wydatkami, i ponieważ jest kwarantanna, to myślę o konsoli do grania. Miałem PS2, miałem PS3, teraz obie są sprzedane. Jakoś nie umiem się odnaleźć w przestawieniu na Xboxa, więc po głowie chodzi zakup PS4, zaczekać na PS5, a może jednak skusić się na Nintendo Switch o którym słyszałem wiele dobrego. Aaaale... Jestem tak bardzo casualowym graczem, nie bardzo mogę grać w strzelanki (mój błędnik na ma to swoje świetne pomysły) że rozważam... Apple Arcade. Tzn. jak na moje potrzeby (i umiejętności) Arcade jako rozrywka - wystarcza. Ale żeby wykorzystać ciut większy ekran, chciałbym skorzystać z połączenia z Apple TV. Tylko teraz zgryz, czy kupować teraz rozwiazanie z przed kliku lat (Apple TV 4K), czy zaczekać na nową generację, która albo będzie warta kupienia, albo będzie sprawcą obniżenia kosztów 4K. Tylko kiedy to nastąpi... i bądź tu mądry. [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]], [[casual player]]\n12.  W temacie Apple i tego, że nowy IPad coraz bardziej przypomina komputer, włącznie z tą wyczesaną klawiaturo / stojako / obudową.. za 1500 złotych. Klawiatura za 1500 złotych, IPad niezmiennie za 4.500; I z jednej strony mam wrażenie - takiego wyczesanego stojaka dotychczas nie widziałem, ale ta cena mnie nokautuje. [[Apple]]\n13.  I wreszcie w temacie nokautujących cen, a zatem finansów osobistych i oszczędności... Teraz dość mocno jesteśmy skupieni na walce z Covid-19, ale jak już się z tym uporamy (a uporamy, nie wiemy tylko jakim kosztem) to przyjdzie nam zmierzyć się z kryzysem. Dużym, bo problemy sieją się szeroko. Branża turystyczna, eventową, gastronomiczna, usługi wszelakie, wynajem krótkoterminowy - to wszystko oberwie. Wróć, to wszystko już obrywa. To będzie miało przełożenie na system bankowy (bo kredyty nadal trzeba będzie spłacać, a w czasach prosperity kredyty były dawane z szerokim gestem... cholera, to już gdzieś graliśmy). Dorzućmy do tego fakt, że problemy są globalne, cena ropy poleciała na pysk (tak tak, mamy wojnę na tym rynku, a cena ropy jest najniższa od 2002 roku, bo duzi chłopcy chcą sobie coś udowodnić). I jeszcze linie lotnicze będą w tarapatach. Ostatnią szczyptą którą doprawimy to danie będzie jeszcze kryzys zaufania. Powszechnego. Wszystkiego do wszystkich. Ludzi do władzy i ludzi do ludzi (bo tak długo, jak nie będziemy wiedzieli jak sobie z wirusem poradzić, tak długo każdy jest potencjalnym zagrożeniem. Zagrożeniem dla mnie i dla mojej rodziny, więc wybacz, to nic osobistego, ale trzymajmy się na dystans). Czyli... tak na moje rozeznanie, za rogiem czycha kryzys. [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n14.  Skoro jestem taki mądry, to pewnie się do tego kryzysu przygotowałem. Cóż... nie. I to jest w tym wszystkim najbardziej dla mnie irytujące. Niby mam dość, żeby być spokojnym w perspektywie miesiąca, dwóch, pięciu (tak długo jak długo złotówka jeszcze lekko dycha), natomiast to co mam bardzo szybko może być warte zdecydowanie mniej, jeśli nie nic, a ja nie umiem za bardzo zrobić teraz cokolwiek, żeby temu zapobiec (na to jest za późno, na to za mało umiem). A równocześnie mam za mało, żeby kryzys wykorzystać do zgromadzenia więcej (bo tak, historia raz po raz udowadnia, że kryzys to najlepszy czas na to, żeby się wzbogacić.. jeśli się tylko umie.. albo ma dość cojones). [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]], [[pieniądze]]\n15.  To czego nie rozumiem, to tego czemu nasze Państwo postanawia czynić pieniądz tańszym (obniżając stopy procentowe), ale utrzymując zobowiązania wobec przedsiębiorców, które mogą ich tylko dobić, udając że zasiłek w wysokości 5 tysięcy złotych cokolwiek zmieni. Nic nie zmieni, co [skwapliwie wykazał Robert Gwiazdowski.](https://www.rp.pl/Felietony/303189873-Robert-Gwiazdowski-Pozyczka-5-tys-ZUS-przez-rok-to-ponad-15-tys.html) [[Robert Gwiazdowski]], [[pieniądze]]\n16.  Ważna rzecz - tylko dzięki temu, że kilka lat temu zacząłem robić jakiekolwiek oszczędności, teraz mam jeszcze resztki włosów na głowie i jeszcze dość dobrze śpię. Udało mi się zgromadzić poduszkę finansową, która mimo złożenia wypowiedzenia ze efektem na połowę marca (brawo Wit, zawsze miałeś wyczucie czasu), pozwala mi spokojnie (jeszcze przez chwilę) czekać na to, co będzie za zakrętem. I równocześnie przeraża mnie, jak (wedle statystyk) niewielu ludzi ma ten komfort... Z tego miejsca, raz jeszcze wielkie dzięki @[Michał Szafrański](https://jakoszczedzacpieniadze.pl/) i @[Maciej Samcik](https://subiektywnieofinansach.pl/).

Niezmiennie przypominam - oszczędzanie nie musi być trudne. Za to trzeba zacząć. Nawet od bardzo małych kwot. I najlepiej tak, żeby nie było potrzebne nasze zaangażowanie - tu o tym, [jak można oszczędzić 1000 złotych bez wysiłku](https://niecodzienny.net/2017/02/oszczedzic-tysiac-zlotych-bez-wysilku/). [[pieniądze]], [[napisane przez Wita]]\n18.  I tu dochodzimy do jednego wniosku. Jak już się sytuacja troszeczkę uspokoi, zacznę się uczyć inwestowania. Z dwóch powodów. Po pierwsze, bo to już ten czas (kiedy trzymanie więcej pieniędzy na koncie / lokacie przestaje być dowodem rozsądku, a raczej przesłanką do podkreślenia niezaradności). Po drugie... bo każda nauka zaczyna się od stanu 0. Skoro (mam wrażenie) mnie na to stać, to nie warto tracić czasu i odwlekać tego. Trzeba zacząć. [[Wit się uczy]], [[pieniądze]]\n19.  W sumie wątek nauki wymaga komentarza. Bo nagle okazało się, że nauczyciele są ważni i potrzebni, bo ktoś jednak pomaga nam w wychowaniu dzieci i pomaga w zorganizowaniu im kilku godzin dziennie, codziennie. Nagle zostali zauważeni przez rodziców i przez władzę. Tę samą władzę, która rok temu postanowiła zastąpić nauczycieli na egzaminach leśnikami i strażakami. Równocześnie nagle wzrosło też zapotrzebowanie na lekarzy i pielęgniarzy (obu płci). Podpowiedź dla władzy - szanujcie ludzi wszystkich zawodów, bo jak się okazuje, każdego kogo obrażacie, potem nagle potrzebujecie. To wam jeszcze wybuchnie w twarz. [[pedagogika]], [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n20.  Smutne też jest to, że wydaje nam się, że będziemy mogli przenieść dotychczasową edukację z dnia na dzień ze szkoły do chmury. I nagle uważamy za zasadne oczekiwanie, że wszyscy nauczyciele w ciągu kilku dni przejdą do płynnego obsługiwania nowych narzędzi i że nauczą tego nasze dzieci. I że mają na to sprzęt, którego przecież nikt im nie dostarcza. A wszystko zrobi to grupa ludzi, których nie szanujemy i którym nie płacimy, ani nie rozwijamy. Przecież to się kupy nie trzyma. [[pedagogika]], [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n21.  Aha, i jak zawsze wszyscy lepiej od nauczycieli wiemy, jak powinni uczyć w czasie epidemii. Nie wiemy. Nie znamy się na tym. Nie musimy być we wszystkim najmądrzejsi. Weźmy na wstrzymanie, proszę. [[pedagogika]], [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n22.  Skoro nie mam czasu pisać i czytać, rysuję. Wróciłem do piłowania oka.

Zobaczyć, aby zrozumieć. Ten filmik pokazywałem już na FB, ale mam wrażenie że on najlepiej pokazuje jak i - przede wszystkim dlaczego - powinniśmy myć ręce dłużej. I nie chodzi o żadne śpiewanie pod nosem „happy birthday” (choć jako Wiślak uważam że doskonale się sprawdza „jak długo na Wawelu” 😀 ), ale o to, żeby to robić dokładnie. I to jest też doskonała podpowiedź dla wszystkich chcących coś wytłumaczyć - jeśli możesz - pokaż, nie opisuj.

Za mną kolejny odcinek nauki robienia kawy w kawiarce Bialetti. Jeszcze nie umiem ogarnąć grubości mielenia (gdyż nie posiadam dobrego młynka) aaale już wiem, że - do kawiarki wlewamy gorącą wodę (aby skrócić czas ekstrakcji i możliwie krótko gotować kawę - dłuższe gotowanie = gorycz), stawiamy kawę na średni ogień (na indukcji daję 6tkę), i kiedy kawa zaczyna bulgotać - zdejmujemy ją. Wtedy jest delikatniejsza. [[Wit się uczy]], [[kawa]]\n3.  Cały czas mam problem z kaloriami. Ze zrozumieniem kalorii. Chciałbym wiedzieć, jak kalorie przekładają się na wagę. I - jeszcze ważniejsze - ile trwa odkładanie sie kalorii, czyli „ile czasu potrzebuje nasz organizm, aby zamienić kalorie na masę”. Nie umiem wyobraźnia ogarnąć tego, jak 100g orzeszków solonych może mieć 612 kcal, a te 612kcal to mniej więcej 1/3 dziennego zapotrzebowania energetycznego. I jak ta energia się przekłada na masę. No jak? [[co jesz jeżyku]]\n4.  Bo, gdybyście o tym nie wiedzieli, kiedy chcemy zrzucić trochę kilogramów, to nie robimy tego przez pot (relatywnie niewiele wagi tą drogą tracimy), ale przez wydech (wydalając CO2). Przez wydech? Ale jak to? Przecież to nie możliwe. No cóż... To popatrzmy na to inaczej, trochę na odwrót. Skąd bierze się masa drzewa? Z wody? Ze słońca? Z nawozu? Nie, z powietrza. Serio, z powietrza. Ale jak to jak to jak to? No tak to, że przy procesie fotosyntezy, drzewo zamienia CO2 na C i O2. O2 oddaje, C zatrzymuje. C robi masę. [[jak działa świat]]\n\n\thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KZb2_vcNTg\n\n5.  To swoją drogą jest przyczynek do tego, jak nas (nie) uczą, albo jak bardzo się nie umiemy uczyć. Uczymy się by zapamiętać, nie by zrozumieć. To mnie za każdym razem smuci. [[jak korzystać z wiedzy]]\n6.  Wracając do moich kalorii. Wychodzi na to, że nie ma jakiejś jednej \"złotej zasady\". Raczej wszystko zależne jest od aktywności, trawienia i indywidualnego metabolizmu. Awrrrr... I klucz kryje się w metaboliźmie. Skomplikowane to nasze ciało. Szukam i czytam dalej, Nadal próbuję zrozumieć, ile czasu ciało potrzebuje na zamianę tej garści orzeszków na energię i decyzję, czy wykorzysta, czy zmagazynuje... [[co jesz jeżyku]]\n7.  O rysowaniu... Pamiętam że moja przygoda z odświeżonym rysowaniem [zaczęła się przypadkowo](https://niecodzienny.net/2017/04/ludzie-robcie-ludziom-dobrze/) od książki „jak rysować postacie” i zakochałem się w tym, ze mogę (umiem) narysować kucharza na paragonie i on wygląda jak kucharz. To było dla mnie olśnienie, które doprowadziło do tego, ze teraz rysuję oczy, które chyba wyglądają jak oczy. Natomiast tu jest inna podpowiedź jak rysować [[wit rysuje]]: \n\n\thttps://www.facebook.com/Schrittanleitungen/posts/653305885507549\n\n8.  Jeszcze w temacie rysowania i tego że kiedy mózg coś sobie ubzdura i tego chce, to to dostanie. Kiedy Apple pokazało Pencil'a po raz pierwszy, pomyślałem - nigdy tego nie kupię. Wtedy nawet nie myślałem, że kiedykolwiek będę cokolwiek rysował. Kiedy wypuścili dwójkę, byłem przekonany - nigdy tego nie kupię. Potem zacząłem sobie szkicować, potem Bartek powiedział że on bardzo lubi notatki z pomocą Pencila robić... wrrrr... Przecież mi to nie potrzebne... ale zacząłem wokół tego chodzić. Ale to niepotrzebnie drogie.. zacząłem kombinować. Szukać z drugiej ręki... powtarzać sobie, żę tego nie potrzebuję. No ale żeby nie przynudzać... Od miesiąca mam Pencila. I Procreate. I uczę się rysować z jego pomocą... I cholera to jest tak zupełnie inne od szkicowania... [[wit rysuje]]\n\n![](https://i1.wp.com/niecodzienny.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_0368.png?fit=560%2C389\u0026ssl=1)\n\nProcreate, Pencil, Kawa, Wit \n\n9.

Jest takie danie, które robię raz na pięć lat. [Lasagna z przepisu z Australijskiego Masterchefa](https://niecodzienny.net/2010/09/facet-w-kuchni-lasagna-podlana-sukcesem/). To niezmiennie pół dnia spędzonego w kuchni, które potem można podsumować 30 sekundowym filmikiem, ale... o mamo, jakie to jest smaczne. Nieskromny w tym względzie jestem...

O tym, że nie wszystko może być \"just in time\", o tym, że wiele z tego co mieliśmy za pewnik, jest jednak fikcją. O tym, że kiedy jest dobry czas, to trzeba oszczędzać na gorsze momenty, a nie wierzyć, że tak jak jest, będzie zawsze (dotyczy i obywateli i firm i państwa). Bo to naprawdę słabe, kiedy załatwia nas miesiąc przestoju. My nie wiemy co będzie za tydzień, ale już teraz mówimy, że będziemy masowo potrzebowali pomocy. To źle świadczy także o nas. Bo to znaczy, że żyjemy wyłącznie z dnia na dzień. Że nie umiemy przewidywać. I jasne, że ciężko jest się przygotować na takie coś jak ta choroba, ale dotychczas przyszedł jedynie strach i już on nas rozkłada na łopatki. [[jak działa świat]], [[jak korzystać z wiedzy]], [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n12.  I dobrze by było coś produkować, bo produkcja potrzebnych artykułów, ma dużo większą wartość niż najlepsza nawet usługa. To jedna z moich bolączek - ja nie produkuję nic namacalnego. Nie stawiam muru, nie wytwarzam nic, nawet maseczki nie umiem uszyć. Nic z moich 15 lat zawodowej pracy nie jest realne, rzeczywiste. To kiepsko o mnie świadczy. Bieżąca sytuacja może nas nauczyć weryfikacji tego co namacalne. Może jednak przestaniemy wierzyć w tokeny wartości osobistej (mój prywatny rzyg). Nikt chyba nie wie jak bedize wyglądał świat za tym wirażem, ale jak już zaczniemy wracać do jakotakiej równowagi, to bedziemy musieli przypomnieć sobie jak się stawia fundamenty. Na usługi przyjdzie pora w drugiej, trzeciej, czwartej kolejności. A my w większości usługami stoimy. I jesteśmy do tego trudnego czasu nieprzygotowani (nikt nam w tych przygotowaniach nie pomagał, ale do tej pory bardzo chcieliśmy mówić o tym, że trzeba pielęgnować w sobie samodzielność). [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n13.  Jest jeszcze problem tego, że różne są usługi i różna jest ich wartość. Możemy uznać, że bezpieczeństwo czy edukacja są formą usługi świadczonej przez część ludzi, tylko z jakiegoś przedziwnego powodu, uznaliśmy, że mamy usługi, za które jesteśmy skłonni więcej płacić niż policjantowi, pielęgniarce czy nauczycielowi. A teraz jak trwoga, to pędzimy do nich z prośbą \"ratuj\".  [[wit o prokrastynacji]]\n14.  Ostatnia rzecz, która może nam się w tym wszystkim najmniej podobać. Może się zdarzyć, że na usługę, którą świadczymy teraz zapotrzebowanie będzie mniejsze, za to będziemy mogli / musieli robić inne rzeczy, które dotychczas nie były w obszarze naszego chcę. Mało przyjemna perspektywa, zwłaszcza w świecie, w którym przecież każdy może być każdym. [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n15.  Słówko o epidemii i o tym jak bardzo spadła na nas ona niespodziewanie. Że nikt tego nie mógł przewidzieć. Że to czarny łabędź. Czytam książkę, która opisuje przerażająco dokładnie stan obecny, próbuje wyjaśnić co z czym jest skorelowane, co z czego wynika, co ile wymaga czasu (np. wytworzenie szczepionki), pokazuje też ile to będzie kosztować. Taka mądra ksiażka. [[Michael Osterholm]], [[Our War Against Killer Germs]]. Kilka cytatów:\n\n\u003e Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the world has changed. The nonprofit Fund for Peace’s Fragile States Index was much higher in 2016 than a similar study would have showed in 1975, and it is more difficult now than it was forty years ago to get the international community to work together to achieve a common goal. Today, there are more than forty countries with no more than a marginal ability to govern.\n\n\u003e Today, we live in a just-in-time-delivery economy where virtually nothing is warehoused for future sales, let alone stockpiled for a crisis situation. Not even the parts and components necessary to manufacture these critical supplies are warehoused or stockpiled. When a rolling global pandemic takes its toll on the working population of a city in Asia, for example, the products and supplies that come from that city—and perhaps nowhere else—that we need to respond to a rapidly growing pandemic will not be available. No amount of money can buy  \n\u003e something that doesn’t exist.\n\n\u003e Pandemic can shut down regional, national, or even international commerce, which in turn can lead to economic chaos, which in turn can lead to destruction of confidence in unstable governments. If a government’s authority is shaky to begin with, the stress of a pandemic can lead to a failed state, which in turn can lead to anarchism and terrorism. At the same time, while the pandemic is occurring, other endemic and noninfectious diseases are still affecting the population, the combination of which can eventually tax or even break the existing healthcare  \n\u003e delivery system.\n\n\u003e Every time there is a new, serious viral outbreak, such as Ebola in 2012 and Zika in 2016, there is a public outcry, a demand to know why a vaccine wasn’t available to combat this latest threat. Next a public health official predicts a vaccine will be available in x number of months. These predictions almost always turn out to be wrong. And even if they’re right, there are problems in getting the vaccine production scaled up to meet the size and location of the threat, or the virus has receded to where it came from and there is no longer a demand for prevention or treatment.\n\n\u003e As vaccine development progresses, there are various internal tests, and then animal testing. Then there are three phases of human trials. Phase I tests safety. Phase II tests various dosage levels for safety and effectiveness. Phase III tests the actual effectiveness of the drug or vaccine on a large enough cohort of human subjects to allow for variations in response, factoring in considerations such as how the vaccine affects children, teens, persons over sixty-five, persons with an immunocompromising condition, pregnant women, and so on. Today a pharmaceutical company can expect that getting a new vaccine licensed will take more than a decade of work and a billion dollars of investment.\n\n\u003e The irony is that there’s really no reward for being the one who anticipates the challenge.\n\u003e \n\u003e Deadliest Enemy: Our War Against Killer Germs by Michael T. Osterholm, Mark Olshakernone\n\n16.  I wiecie co, najsmutniejsze w tej ksiażce jest to, ze ona została napisana w 2017 roku. Badum tsss.  [[Michael Osterholm]], [[Our War Against Killer Germs]]\n17.  Pamiętam o tym, że ocenianie jakości proroctwa z perspektywy efektów, jest okraszone znacznym błędem (gdyż widzimy wyraźnie to proroctwo, które się spełniło, a nie wszystkie inne, które też zostały przygotowane przez bardzo mądrych ludzi). O tym efekcie pisał już Gladwell. Ale to, jak bardzo lekceważymy znane zagrożenia, to zdecydowanie przerażająca wizja. [[jak działa świat]]\n18.

Często jest tak, że spodziewamy się, że ktoś zrobi za nas. Że zadecyduje, zbada, rozwiąże. Cóż... wychodzi mi na to, że mamy czasy w których powinniśmy przestać liczyć na naszych rządzących (bo... nawet jeśłi nas nie okłamują wprost, to dobierają fakty i narrację do swoich potrzeb), i zrozumieć, że to w naszej gestii pozostaje wiele rzeczy. Dostosowanie, zależne od nas, nie od rządzących. Mogę to robić i jednostki i organizacje, które - tak de facto - nie muszą, bo działają w biznesie. Ale czują odpowiedzialność wobec ludzi (czego niestety zbyt często nie mogę powiedzieć o politykach, ale to chyba dlatego, że zbyt wielu wśród nich małych ludzi).

Ciekaw jestem, czy jest taki moment w życiu jednostki, kiedy stwierdza, że zasięg jego odpowiedzialności daleko wykracza poza jego najbliższy krąg rodzinny. Że jego sprawczość wynikająca z pozycji zawodowej, autorytetu przeniosła się na wyższy poziom i teraz od tego czy coś się zadzieje czy nie, zależy od niego. Ciekaw jestem, czy to rodzi się / budzi się w człowieku samodzielnie (w odpowiedniej chwili), czy może wynika z ludzi, którzy go kształtują i uczą a w pewnym momencie to także uświadamiają... a może potrzebuje bodźca i takiego stuknięcia w czoło - Wodzu, to właśnie teraz.

Co piątek, po opublikowaniu tygodniówki mam moment ulgi (bo kolejny raz udało się spisać swoich kilkanaście punktów), za którym zaraz zaczyna się moment małego przerażenia, bo wiem, że przede mną właśnie otworzyła się pusta notka, którą przez kolejne dni będę chciał zapełnić, pytanie tylko, czy mi się to uda.. czy będę miał o czym pisać. Czy podtrzymam tę chęć „co tygodniowego wpisu”. Nawet jeśli to zobowiązanie, które mam wyłącznie w głowie i... nic się nie stanie, jeśli tego nie zrobię (tzn tekst nie powstanie, Wy go nie przeczytacie, ale tego nikt nie zauważy, to będzie tylko jakaś drobna porażka / drobne potknięcie w moim blogowaniu - nie przełoży się na nic wielkiego). Więc, nie ma presji, gdy tego nie zrobię. Ale gdy klikam w publikuj jest uderzenie endorfin. Jak po treningu. Uzależnia. Pytanie na ile skutecznie. [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]]\n2.  Równocześnie, ja to wiem, ale o tym nie piszę, bo to moja tygodniówka, więc czemu miałbym robić sobie pod górkę;-) W każdym razie - w tygodniówce nie wspominam o tym wszystkim, czego nie zrobiłem, o tym wszystkim o czym zapomniałem, o wszystkich nieprzeczytanych książkach, nienapisanych tekstach. Także, @Marcin, przecież wiesz, że ten punkt to dla Ciebie piszę. Tygodniówką zakrzywiam postrzeganie rzeczywistości, dobierając wybiórczo fakty, abym mógł jakoś że sobą żyć. Ale ja to wiem, najlepiej. [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]]\n3.  O czym nie pamiętałem w zeszłym wpisie - kilka podpowiedzi o tym, jak wykorzystać czas ze swoim dzieckiem, którego nagle mamy w nadmiarze: [[pomysły na wolny czas]]\n\n\thttps://www.facebook.com/wholebeingscollective/posts/1604940379644026\n\n4.  Na Fejsie i we wszelkich socjalach mnóstwo komentarzy o tym, jak to ciężko z dziećmi wytrzymać. Jak to bardzo chcą naszej uwagi, jak to bardzo chcą żebyśmy im poświęcili swój czas. Niech to się skończy, niech ich ktoś weźmie, niech im ktoś zorganizuje czas. Jak to o nas świadczy, jako o rodzicach? I to po ledwie kilku dniach. [[pedagogika]], [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n5.  Pamiętam jak kilka ładnych lat temu Wojtek opowiadał, że mniej więcej po dwóch tygodniach od zostania ojcem powiedział „No wszystko bardzo fajnie, ale kiedy wszystko wróci do normy? A... od teraz to jest norma”. No właśnie. Rodzicem nie jest się z kaprysu, tylko rodzicem się człowiek staje i w tym stanie już trwa. [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n6.  W tym miejscu będzie też samokrytyka. Bo zbyt często czuję, ze mógłbym być lepszym ojcem (nikt mi nie broni, pewnie nawet powinienem być), ale widzę też, że mam genialnego syna (co staram się mu mówić przy każdej okazji), któremu też nie jest łatwo. Który wolałby się bawić na polu (a jak!), albo z kolegami i koleżankami w przedszkolu. A musi użerać się ze mną, gościem trudnym w obsłudze. [[wit jako ojciec]], [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]]\n7.  I oczywiście że jazda na nauczycieli, czego to nie robią, a co powinni robić i że powinni to robić lepiej. Wiecie co? Teraz macie okazję, aby błyszczeć. Aby pokazać że potraficie to lepiej. Że umiecie okiełznać swoje dziecko tak, jak oczekujecie tego od nauczycieli. Albo zobaczyć, że jednak nie jest tak łatwo organizować czas istotom, które niezwykle łatwo się nudzą 😉 Pokażcie, co potraficie. I czy potraficie lepiej.

To, swoją drogą, nie jest tylko specyfika Polski. Wszędzie zderzamy się z \"social distancingiem\" i jego konsekwencjami. Nikomu nie jest łatwo. Ani rodzicom, ani uczniom, ani nauczycielom. Wszyscy zostaliśmy złapani w pół kroku. [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n9.  Na całe nasze szczęście, Internet i Youtube nie pojawiły się wczoraj. Są ludzie, którzy dają lekcje przez internet, całe kursy. O wszystkim, na każdym poziomie zaawansowania. Ta sama wiedza, przekazywana na dziesiątki jeśli nie setki sposobów. Ludzie z pasją, ludzie z konikiem, ludzie z pomysłami. Często ludzie bez budżetów. Przecież Internety nie są tylko dla przerysowanych influencerów z wynajętych mieszkań. Są też pełne normalnych ludzi, którzy chcą się dzielić swoją wiedzą. Można z tego brać garściami. [[jak korzystać z wiedzy]], [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n\n![](https://niecodzienny.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/i_will_teach_you.jpg)\n\n10.  Wtedy na scenę wchodzą oni, cali na biało. TVPiS z swoją karykaturalną wizją szkoły w telewizji i Prezydent na TikToku. To był ten moment ubiegłego tygodnia kiedy mój żenadometr eksplodował. [[polska]], [[pedagogika]]\n11.  O prezydencie nie będę się wyrażał, bo to człowiek, który jest swoją własną najlepszą cezurą. O ludziach którzy próbują robić telewizję edukacyjną mogę powiedzieć tylko - przykro mi. Nie umiecie tego robić w telewizji, zostaliście wsadzeni na minę, ludzie nie dadzą wam żyć. To jedno potrafimy niesamowicie dobrze, zagryźć dla uciechy własnej i otoczenia. Jesteście słabi, popełniacie błędy, nikt nie powinien wam na to pozwolić. Tylko, że ktoś na to pozwala. Ktoś uznaje, że ta chora wizja jest warta pokazywania bez wstydu. Gorzej - ktoś może uznawać, ze taki model jest wart upubliczniania i przedstawiania polskiej szkoły właśnie w ten sposób. Bo jeśli nie masz dziecka w szkole, to skąd masz wiedzieć, jak wyglądają lekcje? Jak do tych lekcji przygotowani są nauczyciele? W tym kontekście dziwnie cierpko smakuje ten nasz rechot. Nie moje to spostrzeżenie - poczytajcie tu: [https://oko.press/upiorna-groteska-lekcji-z-tvp-tak-wladza-widzi-szkole-i-nauczycieli/](https://oko.press/upiorna-groteska-lekcji-z-tvp-tak-wladza-widzi-szkole-i-nauczycieli/) [[wit o rzeczywistości]], [[pedagogika]], [[opis obyczajów]]\n12.  Na osłodę i na przełamanie. Znam paru bardzo zdolnych ludzi, cholernie im zazdroszczę. Pawłowi na przykład, zazdroszczę umiejętności rysowania. I to takiego, że trzy kreski postawi i wszystko widać. Paweł ma swój styl i swoją misję. Rozweselać ludzi chce. Dawać im powód do uśmiechu (nie mylić z rechotem). Więc żarty codziennie poranne na fejsbuku publikuje. Jakiś czas temu Paweł spytał mnie... a może raczej pytanie w przestrzeń puścił, a ja akurat w przestrzeni sie znalazłem, czy sens jest w tym co robi, czy sensu szukać powinien gdzie indziej. Więc, zazdrością kierowany, powiedziałem Pawle rysuj, boś zdolny. No i on rysuje. No zobaczcie sami, że zdolny: [nordic walking by Paweł J](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9PsfyshfX2/) [[zdolni ludzie]]\n\n13.  I tak sobie myślę, że... fajnie jest pokazywać zdolnych ludzi. Pokażcie mi proszę zdolnych ludzi. Może warto stworzyć taką nieoczywistą galerię? A jak już w Jaworskiego zerknęliście, to powiedzcie, który z obrazków Wam przypadł do gustu. [[zdolni ludzie]]\n14.  Słówko o emocjach. Każdemu polecam obejrzenie „w głowie się nie mieści”, bo to bajka, która pięknie uczy i uświadamia rolę emocji i pewne etapy w życiu rozjaśnia, ale dzisiaj wspominając w rozmowie akurat ten film uświadomiłem sobie, że w przypadku emocjI też można sie posłużyć metaforą kulinarną (czyli moją najukochańszą forma metafor) - „emocje są jak kubki smaki na języku. Wszystkie są potrzebne, bo bez nich, nic nie będzie smakować nam tak samo” [[sztuka]], [[emocje]]\n15.  Znalezione ćwiczenie ocierające się trochę o medytację dla dzieci. \n\n\thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18SpO_lyH2Q\n\n16.  Skoro w tym tygodniu motywem przewodnim jest edukacja, to musze się przyznać, zapuściłem się z sięganiem po kolejne książki. To ogólnie jest też refleksja szersza, dotyczące tego, jak wraz z powrotem do Krakowa zmieniła się ilośc czasu, którą mogę rozporządzać. Jest to powiązane z kwarantanną, ze stałą obecnością wszystkich mieszkańców w domu, w tym że w zasadzie nie ma czegoś takiego jak samotność i prywatność. Duża zmiana, w porównaniu z tym, ze jeszcze miesiąc temu nie miałem czasem do kogo gęby otworzyć. A miało być o edukacji... [[niedoskonały wit]], [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n17.  Kilka punktów wyżej wspominałem o tym, że sieć jest pełna wiedzy. Także darmowej. I tutaj dzięki rekomendacji znalezionej na [Appfunds](https://appfunds.blogspot.com/2020/03/zachowaj-plynnosc.html), rozpocząłem kurs o globalnych rynkach finansowych. Z Yale. Prowadzony przez Noblistę. Przecież to jest niepojęte... Ponieważ chciałbym się dowiedzieć troszkę więcej o tym, jak można inwestować pieniądze, wybrałem się na kilkutygodniowy kurs, który ma pozwolić troszkę zrozumieć rynek finansowy, prowadzony przez gościa, który dzięki swojej wiedzy, dostał BardzoWażnąNagrodę. I ja mogę z tego korzystać. Nie ruszając tyłka z fotela. XXI wiek ma jednak plusy 😉 [https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-markets-global/home/info](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-markets-global/home/info) Ciekawe czego się nauczę... [[jak korzystać z wiedzy]], [[Wit się uczy]]\n18.  Na razie zrobiłem półtorej tygodnia materiału w tydzień. I... czuję się trochę jak wolny słuchacz. Słucham z zainteresowaniem, ale nie zapisuje wielu notatek. Tzn zapisuję notatki, ale bardziej związane z obserwacjami o świecie, niż ze wzorami jakie wykładowca podaje. Co też sobie zanotowałem? [[rzeczy niedokończone]], [[pieniądze]], [[Wit się uczy]]\n\n\u003e So there aren't that many things that you can do as an individual that are useful, you have to join an organization.\n\u003e \n\u003e Robert Shillernone\n\n\u003e Because finance is a real technology. They're (poor countries) not so interested in getting foreign aid, they don't need foreign aid, they just need the right principles and the wealth appear on it's own.\n\u003e \n\u003e Robert Shillernone\n\n\u003e You can't really escape the fundamental problem that business involves intuitive judgment, risk taking, you'll never know all of the risks, you know, that you have to be at some point, just think, \"hey, I'm just going to try it.\" And you might get a bad outcome but I think...\n\u003e \n\u003e Robert Shillernone\n\n19.  Swoją drogą, tak, mam świadomość że z tym uczeniem się o finansach jestem spóźniony o jakiś miesiąc. No góra 10 lat. I że teraz zdecydowanie nie jest czas na to, żeby na gwałt kupować cokolwiek, bo jak się człowiek rzuca na spadające noże, to może sobie zrobić krzywdę. Aaaale... ten szalony czas niedługo się skończy, a jeśli nam się uda, nasze życie będzie trwać i to właśnie będzie ten moment, w którym dobrze by było zacząć się zastanawiać nad wykorzystaniem teraz gromadzonej wiedzy. Albo zostać z nią jak Himilsbach z tym angielskim.  [[pieniądze]], [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n20.  Jeszcze o tym szalonym świecie. Tak go komentuje [[Krzysztof Gonciarz]] (trochę bardzo krzycząc). Ale porównanie do próby kostiumowej jest tak bardzo, bardzo, bardzo w punkt. I spostrzeżenie, że było nam tak dobrze, że wymyślaliśmy sobie problemy, które trzeba rozwiązać. Z resztą, co wam bedę opowiadał, sami zobaczcie: [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n\nhttps://youtu.be/95IJsO4w7R8?t=290\n\n21.

Skoro w sklepach nie ma drożdży, a wszyscy wiemy, że pieczywo nie jest zdrowe... Od jakiegoś czasu eksperymentujemy w domu z samodzielnie przygotowywanymi likierami (wszystko zaczęło się od tego, ze trzeba było coś zrobić z trzema litrami Finlandii, które stały w piwnicy od pępkowki... która była 6lat temu.. wiem, wiem, Mariusz, nawet teraz Ci wstyd za to spożycie, ale cóż, nie jestem statystycznym Polakiem, nie pije (za dużo wódki). A jeśli już piję, to Janusz Gajos style. Wracając do likierów... robiliśmy na kukułkach, na tofifi, na kinderbueno, na werthersach,, na wertersach byl dotychczas najlepsze, ale wreszcie upolowalem cukierki Kopiko i ten likier to jest mistrzostwo. A przepis banalny... [[co jesz jeżyku]]\n    1.  składniki: 300gr kopiko cappuccino, 500ml mleka skondensowanego gostyńskiego niesłodzonego, 450g wódki Finlandia (tak, wiem, wódkę zwykle podajemy w ml.. nie jestem statystycznym Polakiem).\n    2.  Co z tym robimy? Cukierki miksujemy (thermomix 10sekund obroty 10). Dolewamy mleko skondensowane, gotujemy 7minut w temperaturze 70stopni obroty 3, dolewamy powoli wódkę, gotujemy jeszcze 5:30 w temperaturze 70stopni. Potem rozlewamy do buteleczek, schładzamy i chowamy do lodówki. Wieczorem pijemy.\n24.  Nie myślcie sobie, ze przepisem się dziele bezinteresownie. Ja muszę mieć notatkę, żeby moc go odtworzyć...:) [[na przyszłość]]\n25.  A jak już mamy likier, to można zrobić Tyrajmisia. I się zajadać 😉 [[co jesz jeżyku]]\n\n26.  Prawie na zakończenie, małe ogłoszenie... duszpasterskie. Składające się z dwóch podpunktów. [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n    1.  Po pierwsze, **damy radę**. Serio. Przejdziemy przez ten syf. Przez tę chorobę i przez ten kryzys, który zaraz za nią człapie. Niestety wątpię czy wyjdziemy mądrzejsi, ale przejdziemy. To wynika trochę z naszej natury, trochę z uporu, a trochę z tego, że nie mamy innego wyjścia. \n    2.  Po drugie, jeśli nie masz się do kogo odezwać, a czujesz, że chciałbyś / chciałabyś pogadać - **odezwij się do mnie**. Proszę. Tak, to ja proszę Ciebie, żebyś jeśli czujesz, że Ci źle, odezwał / odezwała się do mnie. Może będę umiał pomóc (niestety, może nie), ale... nie chcę, żebyś czuł / czuła się z tym sama. Proszę, odezwij się. Zrób to w komentarzu, zrób to na fejsie, zrób to gdzie Ci wygodnie. Najlepiej już.\n\nJuż o tym wspominałem, ale będę wspominał jeszcze mnie raz.

[[Niecodzienny]], [[newsletter]]\n4.  Czy ja już mówiłem, że drażnią mnie rzeczy sprzedawane w abonamencie? Poszukując wtyczki, która pomoże w ogarnięciu formularza i narzędzia do obsługi wysyłki newslettera, większość rozwiązań sprowadza się do opcji miesięcznego kosztu. I o ile nie mam dużego problemu z regularnym opłacaniem się za wysyłkę maili, o tyle nie rozumiem, czemu plugin formularza ma być co miesięcznym kosztem. Ja wiem że twórcy chcą na nim zarabiać, ale o nawet jeśli byłbym skłonny zapłacić raz, to nie czuję się komfortowo z oczekiwaniem płacenia kolejnego abonamentu. Zdecydowałem się na [Hustle](https://pl.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-popup/) (darmowe) i [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/invite/8b46c181998e5) (na moją skalę darmowe, a linkę daję afiliacyjną). Widać, żem Krakus, c'nie? [[newsletter]], [[subskrypcje]]\n5.  No to jak już wybrałem MailerLite, to przygotowałem też dwa maile, które do Was.. tzn do tych z Was, którzy się zapiszą, na mój newsletter, trafią. Te maile są trochę przewodnikiem, co na Niecodziennym można znaleźć, ale też będzie zestaw 10 tekstów które uważam za swoje najlepsze. I nie, nie było mi łatwo je wybrać. Jakie teksty wybrałem? No żeby się o tym przekonać, trzeba się na newsletter od Wita zapisać. [[Niecodzienny]], [[newsletter]]. A jak się na ten newsletter zapisać, którędy? Tędy: \n\n\tI możecie się spodziewać że Was będę prześladował z tym komunikatem w różnych dziwnych miejscach na blogu. Ale tylko troszeczkę.\n\n6.  Jeszcze w temacie wykorzystywania wiedzy zawodowej do projektów prywatnych.. no cóż, nie stosuję się do swoich rad. Nie bez przyczyny mówi się, że szewc bez butów chodzi. Tu niby obów jakiś jest, ale z reklamowaniem samego siebie i swoich treści jakby trudniej. [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]]\n7.  Planowanie. Staram się od początku roku trochę lepiej podejść do tematu organizacji siebie i planowania swojego czasu. Książka \"stop prokrastynacji\" i wszystkie inne mądre ludzie wspominają o tym, żeby nie tylko zadbać o ograniczenie rozpraszaczy, ale żeby lepiej określić zadania, mieć je spisane. Próbowałem do tego wykorzystywać Notion, ale o ile znakomicie mi się sprawdza do pisania notatek (jak choćby tej) to nie do końca wygodnie planuje mi się z nim mój czas. Szukam narzędzia, które pozwoli mi w poniedziałek rano poświecić 30 - 45 minut na to, żeby określić co w tym tygodniu chcę zrobić, a potem - w razie potrzeby - wejść na poziom dnia. Chciałbym móc to rozbić na trzy aspekty - praca, dom, blog. I chciałbym, żeby to było wygodne. I dostępne (jak notion) na każdym urządzeniu, z którego korzystam. Ja to mam wymagania. [[wit o planowaniu]], [[wit o prokrastynacji]]\n8.  Tak, wiem, kartka papieru by wystarczyła. [[aplikacje]]\n9.  Próbowałem wielu różnych programów i programików. I rzadko kiedy udawało mi się trafić na takie, ktore by mi na dłuższa mete pomagaly. Zatem mamy podejscie numer fyfnaście.

W poszukiwaniu rozwiązania, które miałoby mi służyć do organizowania pracy, zmarnowałem/straciłem/przeznaczyłem już godzinę czy dwie. Moja głowa taka mądra. Mam nadzieję, że to jednak inwestycja i planowanie wejdzie w trochę lepszy, ciut bardziej efektywny tryb. [[w poszukiwaniu efektywności]]\n13.

Nie wiem czemu dopiero teraz o tym pomyślałem, ale zderzając sie z potrzebą, uznałem, że czasem dobrze by było móc dodać sobie coś w rodzaju opisu do pliku na komputerze. Nie tag, nie filtr, nie flagę, tylko komentarz. Jak się na przykład ma dużo prezentacji z różną treścią, a nie chce się kilka razy do pliku zaglądać, żeby sobie przypomnieć, że to jednak jest w innym miejscu, to może być przydatne. Jak się okazuje, na MacOS można dodawać takie właśnie komentarze do pliku i wyświetlać je / mieć do nich wgląd na poziomie findera. Można potem także z wykorzystaniem spotlighta szybko wyszukać. Mega wygodne. Z jednej strony korci mnie, żeby wam to opisać dokładniej, z drugiej to będzie niepotrzebne rozwleczenie tego wpisu. Zapewne będzie z tego krótka notka;-) [[w poszukiwaniu efektywności]]\n16.  Zwątpiłem w Notion i musiałem szybciutko z podkulonym ogonem do Notion wracać. Okazało się, że programy typu todo są nadal programami todo i trochę jednak nie tego szukam. Tzn trochę tak, a trochę nie do końca. W każdym razie po mniej więcej trzech minutach okazało się, że [Any.Do](http://any.do/), który sprawia wrażenie bardzo fajnego rozwiązania, jest... nie dla mnie.   \n    Ja potrzebowałem narzędzia, które pozwoli mi zaplanować na jednej stronie (przestrzeni) zgrubne tematy na dany tydzień podzielone względem obszarów, a potem w razie czego da miejsce na podzielenie tego na poszczególne dni. I jak zacząłem pisać to sobie w [any.do](http://any.do/), to zaraz się okazało, że na wpisaniu czegoś w \"muszę to zrobić tego a tego dnia\" cała zabawa się kończy. A ja potrzebuję żeby można bylo w to kliknąć i się w danym miejscu wypisać. I jeszcze chciałbym, żeby można bylo stworzyć taki szablon, który będę mógł wypełniać w każdym tygodniu. I wtedy uświadomiłem sobie, że takie rzeczy, to ja mogę tylko w Notion robić. [[wit o planowaniu]], [[aplikacje]], \n17.  I jeszcze było by fajniej, gdyby można było dodać kolorki, żeby to było miłe dla oka. I wiecie co, to też się da zrobić. I dzięki temu mój szablon tygodnia prezentuje się tak:\n\n![](https://i1.wp.com/niecodzienny.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/planowanie_notion.jpg?fit=560%2C750\u0026ssl=1)\n[[wit o planowaniu]], [[aplikacje]], \n\n18.

A ten statusik tam kolorkiem zaznaczony, pokazuje mi szybciutko, który tydzień jest teraz wagi najważniejszej. Lubię to. [[wit o planowaniu]], [[aplikacje]], \n\n19.  Czy ja właśnie dałem w nos swojej prokrastynacji? To pewnie za dużo powiedziane, ale... wypełnianie tego planera robi mi dobrze. Także.. przepraszam Notion, dziękuję Notion.  [[wit o planowaniu]], [[aplikacje]], [[wit o prokrastynacji]]\n20.  Swoją drogą, to zwykle pisałem na końcu notatki, ale teraz jest do tego doskonała okazja. Polecam spróbowanie tego... rozwiązania (czyli Notion właśnie). Do robienia notatek. Do planowania rzeczy. Do planowania tygodnia. Do przygotowywania wpisów na blogu. Ta Notka powstała w [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=09ffec06323d4b68a0191a2c4ebccdaf), a ja zostawiam tu link, z którego jeśli skorzystasz i spróbujesz tej aplikacji, ja dostanę ekstra środki na korzystanie z tego narzędzia (wolę, żeby to było jasne). [[aplikacje]], \n21.

Jeśli doczytaliście do końca, mam do Was prośbę. Miejcie oczy otwarte. Wszędzie dookoła Was / Nas, są ludzie, którzy mierzą się z efektami epidemii i zapewne radzą sobie gorzej od nas. Nie chcę, żebyście zaraz robili coś za nich, ale chcę poprosić, żebyście byli gotowi z nimi porozmawiać. I nie czekajcie, czy sami się z tym do Was zwrócą, zapytajcie sami \"jak się czują\". A jeśli widzicie, że komuś jest ciężko, dodajcie otuchy.

Zobrzydzona wszystkim do tego stopnia, że nawet nie ma obchodów. Koszmar. To nie była ani nie jest tragedia, która dotyczyła jednego człowieka. To była i jest tragedia narodu, którą, mam niestety wrażenie, sprywatyzował.[[wit o rzeczywistości]], [[opis obyczajów]], [[smoleńsk]]\n2.  A przy okazji doskonała sposobność dla pewnego niewysokiego posła, aby upokorzyć wszystkich dookoła siebie. Jak to jest, że na życzenie człowieka, który formalnie nie sprawuje żadnej władzy, przepisy łamią marszałek sejmu, premier państwa. Jakim cudem na czele państwa mamy układ mafijny? Który, przy tym wszystkim, toczy otwartą wojnę z sądami. Przecież tym się powinna zająć prokuratura... aa.. no właśnie.

Taką... inną 😉 Grę, bez której nie dowiedziałbym się, czym jest Neko-Neko, Agetori czy Akihi.

To są zebrane historyczne dane dotyczące poziomu stóp procentowych banków centralnych odpowiednio w Stanach, Europie i w Polsce. I generalnie determinują, na ile opłacalne jest oszczędzanie. I można odnieść wrażenie, że od dłuższego czasu jakby nie jest. Co razem z rosnącą inflacją i nadchodzącymi trudnymi ekonomicznie czasami jest cholernie nieprzyjemną perspektywą. To co w tych wykresach mi się najmniej podoba, to trend, który się od dawna utrzymuje i dowodzi mi raczej, że wszelkie hamulce puściły. [[pieniądze]], [[wykresy]]\n\n9.  Że te stopy procentowe są pojęciem abstrakcyjnym z innej planety? Nie wiem kiedy ostatnio sprawdzaliście oprocentowanie na Waszym koncie oszczędnościowym, bo ja dziś dostałem od Aliora informację, że konto _oszczędnościowe_ będzie miało oprocentowanie 0,5 %; Nie, nie pomyliło mi się miejsce przecinka. Trzymanie pieniędzy w banku ma efektywność trzymania pięniędzy w szufladzie. Poczytajcie u [Samcika](https://subiektywnieofinansach.pl/inflacja-w-gore-a-stopy-procentowe-w-dol-realnie-ujemne-stopy-procentowe/), poczytajcie na [bankierze](https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Jak-zyc-z-niskimi-stopami-procentowymi-7860121.html). Ja się na tym nie znam. Na pewno coś pomyliłem. [[pieniądze]]\n10.  Za to kredyt mogę wziąć w Aliorze na 13%, 17% albo 24% RRSO. Pyszne to jest. Przepyszne. Tylko trochę cierpkie. [[pieniądze]]\n11.  Zawsze mi się wydawało, że na wszystko mam czas. Niezależnie od tego, że nie ze wszystkim z czym powinienem być (zawodowo), byłem na czas, miałem takie przeświadczenie, że na wszystko na czym mi zależy, mam czas. [Że zdążę](https://niecodzienny.net/2017/11/najwieksze-klamstwo-swiata/). Że mam więcej czasu, niż rzeczy, na które będę go poświęcał. Cały czas mam na myśli swoje rzeczy. [[wit o prokrastynacji]], [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]]\n\n\tNie mowie tu o perspektywie tego, co zrobię w życiu (gdzie pojadę, co zjem, kogo spotkam, jaki projekt zrealizuje). Raczej mam na myśli taką najbardziej codzienną z codzienności.   \n    Że będę miał czas na czytanie książki, szkicowanie, pisanie, uczenie się, słuchanie podcastów, bycie na bieżąco z wybranymi newsletterami i... i cholera czuję, ze nie wyrabiam się na zakrętach. Co gorsza, to jest ten moment, w którym czuję, że muszę zacząć wybierać sobie to, na co chcę swój czas poświęcić. Bardzo, bardzo mi się to nie podoba, ale z drugiej strony, nie ma wyjścia. Bo robienie wszystkiego na aby aby jest bez sensu. \n12. To podejście wymusza racjonalizację. Ile czasu poświęcę na bloga i newsletter. Ile czasu poświęcę na rysowanie. Ile na czytanie. Z czego zrezygnuję. Z czegoś muszę. Na razie mocno wjechało ograniczenie youtube’a i Netflix’a (i pokrewnych). Rykoszetem obrywają newslettery, które już się spiętrzyły. Boję się tego, co będzie kolejne. [[wit o prokrastynacji]], [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]]\n2.  Jeśli to jest ta dorosłość, to oficjalnie oświadczam, ona mi się bardzo nie podoba.  [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]]\n3.  Z mojej głowy nie znika wątpliwość związana z sensownością moich tygodniówek. Nadal zachwyca mnie utrzymywana w kolejnych tygodniach własna regularność, tak głowię się, czy zasadnym jest poświęcanie na to czasu i pozwalanie też na to, aby uwagę kradły statystyki (czy może ktoś z Was jednak czyta). Przyznaję, troszkę w związku z punktem 12 przeszło przez mi myśl - Wicie, to się efektywnościowo nie spina. Ten czas mógłbyś pewnie lepiej wykorzystać. Więc.. tak, mam to pytanie z tyłu głowy. [[wit o prokrastynacji]], [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]], [[w poszukiwaniu efektywności]]\n4.

Kilka kolejnych cytatów z kursu o finansach, który nadal realizuję: [[pieniądze]], [[Wit się uczy]]\n\n\u003e \tBut see there's a fundamental human error here, that we focus on little things and we panic at little bets. You should be doing, I don't know if you're ready for it. If I actually offer it, I should have asked for a show of hands, if I offered you a coin toss like that, you'd take it, right?  \n\u003e   \n\u003e \tI assume, at least if you learn anything from this course about rationality, you should do it. Any time you get a bet like, it's a small bet, you should, with a positive expected value, expected utility theory says you take it because there's not much concavity to the utility function, but people don't.\n\u003e \n\u003e \tRobert Shillernone\n\n\u003e \tYou're always worried about little losses today.\n\u003e \t\n\u003e \tWe worry so much about losing money, we don't have the idea that on average I'll be fine. I just don't, but you don't feel you don't feel that way. Any time that you make a loss, you kick yourself and you feel bad. So you don't want it, you don't want to take that chance.\n\u003e \n\u003e \tRobert Shillernone\n\t\n\u003e \tWe live in an economy that incentivizes people to capitalize on your psychological quirks. And they strongly incentivize people to do that. That's what the profit motive is all about.\n\u003e \n\u003e \tRobert Shillernone\n\n18.  Jeszcze jedno dziwne pytanie. Tak dobre, jak pytanie o to, co się dzieje z kaloriami, które zjadamy;) Co czyni gospodarkę niemiecką tak wiele lepszą od innych gospodarek europejskich. Bo że są mocniejszym gospodarczo państwem od nas, to zawsze tłumaczymy efektywnością komunizmu i tego, że Polacy zawsze oszukiwali wrogi system. Więc mamy wymówkę w postaci kilkudziesięciu lat \"niedoróbki\". Ale co czyni Niemców bardziej efektywnymi od Francuzów. Albo Anglików? Czy to jest kwestia narodowościowa? Wychowania? Uporu? Niby jesteśmy podobni, mamy tyle samo rąk, tyle samo nóg. Jemy mniej więcej tyle samo i nasza doba też trwa 24godziny. Co sprawia, że są inni? A może nie są inni, o to wszystko efekt inaczej składanego procentu.... Hmm... chyba muszę doczytać. [[one more question]]\n19.  Cały czas mamy wrażenie, że obecna epidemia jest czymś historycznie wyjątkowym. Że to niby czarny łabędź. Zjawisko, którego nie sposób przewidzieć, bo historia go nie zna. Hmm... Tylko że nie trzeba sięgać daleko (w czasie) aby zobaczyć bardzo podobne wydarzenia - rozprzestrzenianie się SARS czy MERS w odpowiednio 2003 roku i 2012. I wiecie co jest najgorsze? Nie to, że nie potrafiliśmy go przewidzieć, najsmutniejsze jest to, że nie potrafiliśmy wyciągnąć wniosków i się przygotować. Jedyne co różni SARS i MERS od Covid-19 jest to, że w przeciwieństwie do poprzedników, ten wirus jest tu. Kilka smutnych cytatów dotyczących SARS. Smutnych, bo cholernie znajomo brzmiących. [[Michael Osterholm]], [[Deadliest Enemy]], [[Koronawirus]]\n\n\u003e “The only tools we had to control SARS were ones we’ve had for hundreds of years.”\n\u003e \n\u003e Deadliest Enemy: Our War Against Killer Germsnone\n\n\u003e **And it’s not just the emerging world that isn’t prepared. As Klain noted, “There is not a city in the U.S. with more than three isolation beds, other than New York. New York has eight.”**\n\u003e \n\u003e Deadliest Enemy: Our War Against Killer Germsnone\n\n\u003e **What eventually stopped the spread was not high-tech medicine, since there wasn’t any specific treatment for SARS. Instead it was implementing impeccable infection control, including isolating patients and making healthcare workers wear protective gear, and then intensive follow-up of both healthcare workers and community contacts, with immediate isolation if they showed any early symptoms of SARS. By mid-May, it looked like the outbreak had tapered off, and Ontario lifted its state of emergency. Within days of the proclamation, the hospitals started filling up again with infected patients. Containment efforts went back into a full-court press, and it took another five weeks before SARS was truly under control in Toronto.**\n\u003e \n\u003e Deadliest Enemy: Our War Against Killer Germsnone\n\n\u003e **That’s the challenge of proactive public health practice. If you prevent something from happening because of your actions, you’ll always be second-guessed as to whether the action was necessary.**\n\u003e \n\u003e Deadliest Enemy: Our War Against Killer Germsnone\n\n20.  Mam z tym cholernym wirusem jeszcze jedno spostrzeżenie. Jesteśmy tacy przekonani, że szczepionka jest już za rogiem. Że nasza nauka taka mądra i taka efektywna. I tacy już jesteśmy wszystkopanowujący. No to... Cóż... Taki wirus HIV jest z nami od lat 60 XX wieku, od 1981 zaczęliśmy się z nim mierzyć na poważnie, i już ~~20..~~ 40 lat póżniej mamy jedynie blisko 40 milionów chorych i około 800 tysięcy śmierci rocznie, związanych z tym wirusem. Za to szczepionka na SARS, który też był poważnym problemem ludzkości, nie tylko nie powstała, ale jeszcze zostawiła branżę farmaceutyczną z niemałymi długami. Nie próbuję powiedzieć - nie znajdziemy szczepionki na CoVID-19 (serio, nie chciałem sie uczyć tego nowego słówka). Chcę powiedzieć - jeśli jesteś pewna / pewien, że szczepionka jest już tu, hold your horses.  [[jak myślą ludzie]], [[jak działa świat]], [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n    źródło danych HIV: https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet\n21.  A może jednak czegoś się przy okazji tej epidemii nauczyliśmy? [[jak korzystać z wiedzy]]\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3955896621101993\u0026set=a.567419879949701\u0026type=3\u0026theater\n\n22.  Choć prawdę powiedziawszy spodziewam się, że na pytanie \"czego nauczyła nas epidemia Covid-19\" odpowiedź będzie brzmiała: [[dziwadełka]]\n\n![](https://niecodzienny.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/skills.jpg)\n\n23.  Na zakończenie myśl o tolerancji. Oczekujemy jej, zwłaszcza od innych. I jesteśmy tolerancyjni, zwłaszcza wobec rzeczy, wobec których należy być / wypada być tolerancyjnym. I jesteśmy tacy mądrzy i tacy ponad wszystkich innych nie tolerancyjnych. A próbowaliście być tolerancyjni wobec ludzi, z którymi się fundamentalnie nie zgadzacie? Na przykład wobec wyborców tej drugiej opcji? Już nie tak łatwo, już nie tak przyjemnie. Sztuką tolerancji jest być tolerancyjnym, akceptować i szanować, kiedy dla nas to jest niewygodne. [[wit o rzeczywistości]],\n24.  Z jakiegoś powodu na mojej skrzynce pojawił się (wyrwał się wszystkim filtrom antyspamowym) mailing od Instapaper, narzędzia z którego nie korzystam od bardzo dawna (można liczyć to w latach). Było to dla mnie na tyle zaskakujące, że dążąc do Inbox zero rzuciłem okiem co tam się znalazło i trafiłem na taki cytat: [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]], [[w poszukiwaniu efektywności]]\n\n\u003e \tYou should, intentionally and tactically, decide which piece of information you can do without, for now.

Ale… nieskromnie powiem, dobra. Nie powstrzymałem się od pisania o polityce, nie powstrzymałem się od cytowania książki o epidemiach (czytając którą mam większe lęki niż sięgając po prozę Stephena Kinga). Znowu dwa słowa o edukacji i… jet nawet moja uwaga do Wiedźmina (tak, wiem, to równie na czasie jak zeszłoroczny śnieg). \n\nDowiecie się co nieco o muzyce, zobaczycie że można pływać bez wody i zobaczycie, że Wit czyta. Na głos. Przed kamerą.\n\n1.  Na dobry początek zacznijmy od podzielenia się pomysłami na kreatywne wykorzystanie dostępnego czasu w warunkach domowych. Ponieważ ostatnio rodzice spędzają z dziećmi dużo więcej czasu, niż mieli w zwyczaju i mogły im się skończyć pomysły jak własne dzieci zabawiać, tu kilka propozycji z gatunku Edukacyjnego \"DYI\". [[wit jako ojciec]]\n\n\t[![](https://niecodzienny.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jabluszkowe_zajecia.jpg)](https://education-static.apple.com/creativity-for-kids/activities.pdf)\n\n\t[![](https://niecodzienny.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/James_Dyson.jpg)](https://www.jamesdysonfoundation.com/content/dam/pdf/US%20challenge%20cards%20with%20cover.pdf)\n\n2.  Wspominałem że korzystam z aplikacji do medytacji Oak i że w ramach tej aplikacji można teraz skorzystać z darmowego kursu medytowania z mantrą. Jedną z pierwszych rzeczy, którą się robi, jest wybór własnej frazy do medytacji. Ja wybrałem „man-ah”. Wszelka zbieżność jest absolutnie przypadkowa. No prawie. [[wit o świadomym korzystaniu]]\n\n\thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_cyiiFaOlw\n\n3.  Niemniej jednak - czy to w ogole ma sens? Moim zdaniem, ma. Cieszę się, że wróciłem do częstszego medytowania. Że znajduję na to czas. Jaki widzę efekt? Spokój. Taki moment ciszy i skupienia się na.. cóż, praktycznie niczym, rodzi we mnie świadomy spokój. A jeśli powiem, że mam wrażenie, że przez chwilę byłem trochę świadomością obok ciała to mi przecież nie uwierzycie.. sam sobie nie wierzę. [[wit o świadomym korzystaniu]]\n4.  Jednym z efektów mojego medytowania jest to, że zmieniają się moje afirmacje i to, że nieco bardziej świadomie z nich korzystam. Zajęło mi to, bagatelka, ponad dwa lata. Ale moje poranne afirmacje brzmią teraz: [[wit o świadomym korzystaniu]], [[afirmacje]]\n    1.  Planuję, ale jestem otwarty na zmianę planów. Chętnie mówię \"Tak\".\n    2.  Jestem cierpliwy.\n    3.  Jestem ciekaw tego, czego nie umiem. Próbuję i sięgam po to, co dla mnie nieznane. Otwieram się na to, co nowe i nieznane.\n    4.  Widzę w sobie wartość, daję sobie prawo głosu, słucham siebie, ufam sobie, szanuje siebie, podziwiam siebie, kocham siebie. To jest źródełko mojego szczęścia, na które nikt inny nie ma wpływu. Daje sobie prawo głosu\n    5.  Dbam o swoje ciało, tym co jem, tym co robię.\n    6.  Staram się zawsze dawać coś od siebie, doceniać i wspierać innych. Słucham innych. Dbam o to, aby być głową i ciałem w jednym miejscu.\n    7.  Jestem ogrodnikiem mojej energii, dbam o to, aby dawała dobre owoce\n    8.  Lubie się uśmiechać, lubię się uczyć, lubię robić to co robię, najlepiej jak potrafię.\n    9.  Jestem wdzięczny\n    10.  Dziś będzie dobry dzień. Jestem ciekaw dziś, lets go\n5.  Ostatnie słówko o moich medytacjach i afirmacjach. Mam wrażenie, że pisząc o nich, pisze coś dla Was i dla świata absolutnie oczywistego. Że przecież wszyscy to robią i zapewne robią to lepiej ode mnie, wiec gdzie ja się wychylam ze swoimi amatorskimi, młodzikowymi obserwacjami czy korektami do tego, co robię. Mam równocześnie poczucie, że to co robię, można (i pewnie należy) robić lepiej. Że jeszcze mam dużo do skorygowania. Tekst, słowo pisane, nie zawsze oddaje emocje, więc chciałem żebyście wiedzieli, że mówiąc Wam o tym, brzmię trochę jak 6-7 letnie dziecko, które w ekscytacji mówi „tato, tato, zobacz co zrobiłem, zobacz jak mi dobrze wyszło”. Wtedy ważniejsze od tego, na ile efektywne jest to, co dziecko zrobiło, jest obserwowanie tym jak bardzo się jara swoimi nowo zdobytymi umiejętnościami. Więc dziele się z Wami emocjami początkującego jaracza, widząc w Waszych oczach cierpliwe zrozumienie „dorośnie, zrozumie”. No ale eeeeej, Jaram się.

Jeśli chciałabyś / chciałbyś wykorzystać czas ograniczonego wychodzenia z domu do poprawienia swoich umiejętności językowych, to mam dla Ciebie człowieka. Bartosz, ma ponad 20 letnie doświadczenie w tłumaczeniu konferencyjnym, ale też bardzo szerokie horyzonty i wiedzę z bardzo wielu dziedzin. Jakie to ma znaczenie? Otóż takie, że potrafi w języku angielskim rozmawiać (to dla poszukujących konwersacji) oraz uczyć na w zasadzie każdym poziomie. A teraz możesz przekonać się czy odpowiada Ci jego sposób prowadzenia lekcji, ponieważ przez pierwszy tydzień będzie dla Ciebie za darmo. **Gorąco polecam**, tym bardziej, że Bartosz ciężko pracował lata temu, żeby ~~wyszlifować~~wyheblować moje umiejętności językowe.

Jak się okazało, Katarzyna, która naprawdę nieprzyzwoicie odległy czas temu była \"Panią Kasią\", która uczyła mnie i moich klasowych kolegów i koleżanki języka polskiego, napisała książkę. Być może w ramach odreagowania. W każdym razie, fragmenty tej książki czytają różni zdolni ludzie i pomyślałem sobie, że ja też chcę. Zanim mój wewnętrzny osioł się zdążył zorientować co jest grane, Kasia się zgodziła, a ja miałem zadanie zmierzyć się z tematem. Tak wyszło: [[wit czyta]]\n\n\thttps://youtu.be/4IJl6wBvx3Q\n\n8.

No dobra. Więc jednak sięgnąłem po Netflixowego Wiedźmina. Z duszą na ramieniu. Spodziewając się najgorszego. I.. no cholera nie rozczarowałem się. Czy raczej niestety, nie rozczarowałem się. Nie wiem za bardzo z czego to wynika, ale w mojej głowie opowieść snuta przez Sapkowskiego jest \"jakaś\". Bohaterowie są \"jacyś\". A tu wszystko jest jakieś takie... Nie mam pojęcia czy chciałbym poznawać tę historię dalej, gdybym jej już nie znał (tak, czuję paradoksalność w konstrukcji gramatycznej tego zdania). Geralt w tym wydaniu sprawia wrażenie totalnie płaskiego. Nie znajduję w nim absolutnie nic interesującego. Yennefer - no też jakoś zupełnie nie. Broni się troszkę Ciri, ale też jeszcze wiele nie pograła. Jedyne co - chyba przypadkiem - wyszło, to Toss a coin to your witcher. Wpada w ucho. Ze smutkiem patrzę na to, jak spłaszczona właśnie została opowieść.. i mając w pamięci, że polska produkcja też tego nie dźwignęła, zastanawiam się, czy ten tekst jest w ogóle przekładalny, czy może oczekiwania wobec niego są zbyt wielkie. [[wiedźmin]]\n12.  Prawie zapomniałem. Nigdy, przenigdy nie próbujcie oglądać Wiedźmina z polskim dubbingiem. Podobno Żebrowskiemu głos podkłada Wiedźmin, ale to musi być legenda miejska, bo nie wierzę, że ktokolwiek wytrwał oglądanie tego serialu w tym modelu dłużej niż 2 minuty. [[jak korzystać z wiedzy]]\n13.  KIlka razy w ostatnim tygodniu usłyszałem że \"świat / życie już nie będzie takie samo\". Hmm... życie nigdy nie jest takie samo. Pantha Rei, pamiętacie? NIhil novi, tylko (hłe, hłe) w nowej odsłonie. Życie już jest inne i paradoksalnie zapominamy jakie było kiedyś. Będzie inne (bo takie już jest). Chyba że będziemy żyli przeszłością. Ale to trochę podwójna strata czasu. [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n14.  Algorytm Youtube'a potrafi zaskoczyć, proponując zupełnie w niezrozumiały dla mnie sposób materiały trochę z innego świata.

I cóż z tego, że nikt ich nie czyta [[jak działa świat]]\n\n16.  W zeszłym tygodniu pokazywałem wam wykresy stóp procentowych z banków centralnych. No to jeszcze jeden wykresik do kompletu.

Oś pozioma to lata. Na szaro zaznaczone są kryzysy finansowe, a ta kreseczka to informacja o tym, ile pieniędzy trzymane jest przez banki w gotówce powyżej rezerw jakich oczekuje od nich FED. I jak na to nałożyć wysokość stóp (bliskich zeru) to coś tu mocno zgrzyta. Pamiętajmy, mało kto umie w pieniądz lepiej, niż banki.\n\n17.

I muszę przyznać, że zacząłem weryfikować swoją opinię. no bo tak [[kfn]], [[Michał Szafrański]], [[subskrypcje]] :\n    1.  Patrzę przez pryzmat zakupu za 450 złotych / rok. I myślę sobie - to (jednorazowo) duży wydatek. Ale równocześnie, wydaję powyżej tej kwoty na codzienne ćwiczenia, i jakoś za przesadnie drogie tego nie uważam.  \n        --- dygresja---  \n        W tym miejscu musze złożyć na siebie donos, bo obiecywałem sobie, że wykupię to (Seven App) w końcu na rok i przynajmniej trochę tu oszczędzę. Do it Wit.   \n        --- koniec dygresji---  \n        Rozważałem zakup Masterclass za blisko 800 złotych rocznie... i też się nie zdecydowałem, bo uznałem za drogie. Jestem patronem i płacę 15 złotych miesięcznie wspierając czysto rozrywkowego twórcę. [A wiedza Michała jest cenna](https://niecodzienny.net/2016/09/gdybys-mial-swoim-zyciu-przeczytac-dwie-ksiazki/). Więc... nie, to nie jest drogo. Ale to nie oznacza, że to jest dla mnie.\n    2.  Poza tym, Wicie, porządkując swoje finanse uznałeś, że warto poświęcać też trochę pieniędzy na edukację. A wiesz też, że dużo się od Michała i jego wiedzy nauczyłeś.\n    3.  Bo tu druga rzecz, co to jest za produkt.. Mam trochę wrażenie, że tu jest jeden podstawowy byt, nazwijmy go \"early access\" opakowany w wiele \"nice to have\" rzeczy, ale raczej niewiele dodających do \"twardej\" wartości\". Plus, jest to forma [zaufania wobec tego co Michał stworzy](https://niecodzienny.net/2018/05/dla-kogo-jest-zaufanie-czyli-waluta-przyszlosci-nowa-ksiazka-michala-szafranskiego/).\n    4.  Tylko cały czas pytanie, czy to jest dla mnie. Czy skorzystam z tego. A jeśli nie skorzystam, to czemu ma mnie boleć, za ile Michał to sprzedaje? I to pytanie - czy to jest dla mnie - jest kluczowe. Bo merytorycznie znając Michała, będzie dobrze.\n    5.  I jeszcze jedna rzecz - jeśli przez rok choć raz pojawi się jedna myśl / jedna oferta / jedno zdanie, które wpłynie na moją codzienność, wpłynie na moją efektywność, wpłynie na moje zarobki, to te 450 złotych może się bardzo szybko zwrócić.\n    6.  Tak więc mam czas do 12 maja na decyzję. Ale jak moje przemyślenia bedą się zmieniać w tym tempie, to mam wrażenie, przypuszczenie graniczące z pewnością, że wiem jak to się skończy.\n22.  Kilka zdań o zaufaniu w dobie wirusa. Zaufanie podkopywane przez brak umiejętności (bo my Ci zaufaliśmy. Zaufaliśmy, że umiesz i potrafisz, a teraz widzimy, mamy obawę, że jednak nie umiesz za bardzo i to nasze zaufanie nadwyręża). To trochę jak kupienie sobie drogich butów, albo uszycie drogiego garnituru. Płacisz i ufasz, że oddałeś zadanie w ręcę specjalisty. Głupio się dowiedzieć, że kiedy chcesz zacząć korzystać z butów czy garnituru, one obcierają, podeszwa jest dziurawa, sznurówki się drą, a garnitur ma ciut przy krótki rękaw, trochę za bardzo pije pod pachami i w kroku. Nawet jeśli to nie jest niemożliwe do chodzenia, to jednak na każdym kroku przypomina o tym, że robota jest spieprzona.   [[polska]], [[pieniądze]], [[jak działa świat]]\n      \n    To teraz pytanie jakim zaufaniem (i jakie powinnismy mieć oczewiwanie) wobec partnera biznesowego, któremu oddajemy blisko polowe wszystkiego co zarobimy? Codziennie, co rok. Ponieważ „blisko połowę” brzmi dość abstrakcyjnie, skorzystam z pojęcia dnia wolności podatkowej. Mówiac blisko połowę Wszystkie pieniądze które zarobiłaś / zarobiłeś w 2019 roku do 8czerwca 2019 wydałeś na Państwo. Całkiem spora inwestycja. Całkiem spore, rokrocznie zobowiązanie.   \n      \n    Więc... ja bym jednak chciał być zadowolony z tego, co kupuje za taki pieniądz, poświęciłbym trochę czasu na to, na co je wydaje.\n23.  A jeśli ktoś mówi, żebym nie kozaczył (@Marcin), bo to ile wydajemy na państwo jest najwyraźniej niewystarczające, dopowiem, że kiedy ktoś oczekuje od nas inwestycji premium, najpierw fajnie by było, żeby pokazał jak umie mądrze zarządzać produktem podstawowym, a nie obiecywał, że dopiero jak rozbije bank to on nam wszystkim pokaże. Poza tym, zdaje się, że przez ostatnie lata, odkąd wstaliśmy z kolan i przestaliśmy być w ruinie, płynnie przeszliśmy do trybu krainy mlekiem i miodem płynącej.  [[polska]], [[pieniądze]], [[jak działa świat]]\n    Wszyscy chcielibyśmy pracować w lovebrandach, a jednak (wbrew obietnicom szarlatanów) nie wszyscy mogą lovebrandem być.\n1.  Zaufanie może być także podkopywane przez to, co się mówi, czego się nie mówi i jak się to mówi. [Bartek Pucek pokazał](https://www.facebook.com/bartek.pucek/posts/3025679044121844), jak o zarażeniach informuje Islandia. Tylko że... nawet gdyby tak dane pokazywało nasze Ministerstwo i Minister Zdrowia, czy Premier czy Telewizja publiczna, to w obecnej sytuacji, nadal ciężko by mi było im zaufać. To co mówią, to jak mówią, to jak zmieniają zdanie w krótkim czasie bez słowa wyjaśnienia, to jak traktują pytających, to jak bezczelni są na każdym kroku sprawia, źe im nie ufam. [[polska]], [[pieniądze]], [[jak działa świat]], [[opis obyczajów]]\n    I to jest problem, bo oni w którymś momencie będą chcieli żebym zaufał ich diagnozie „teraz już możesz wyjść”. Będą chcieli, żebym zaufał państwu. Nie tylko ze swoimi zarobionymi pieniędzmi, ale ze swoim zdrowiem i źyciem. Ze zdrowiem i życiem moich ludzi. Mam z tym problem.\n25.  To nie jest tylko problem w PL, bo można odnieść wrażenie, że nikt nigdzie na świecie nie ogarnia tego, w jakiej skali epidemii żyjemy (plus nie umiemy tego ogarnąć, bo ludzie nie ogarniają wyobraźnia dużych liczb) ale mój problem polega na tym, że mieszkał w Polsce, Polsce,, tu tu tu tu tu. I telewizja Polska państwowa rządowa jak ją zwał, na każdym kroku mi mówi, że jest super i o co mi chodzi, mamy świetny rząd i super prezydenta, ci ludzie to Naprawdę wspaniali fachowcy. No jakoś im nie wierze.[[polska]], [[pieniądze]], [[jak działa świat]], [[opis obyczajów]]\n26.  Ech, miałem już o tym nie pisać. Chciałem ten czas przeznaczyć na czytanie, ale czytając pojawiły się w mojej głowie skojarzenia, a od tych skojarzeń przylazłem składać punkty. I cztery (z tym pięć) pojawiły się za jednym zamachem.\n27.  Kiedy pojawiły się pierwsze komentarze dotyczące CoVID-19, mówiliśmy (w tym ja) albo że „hola hola, grypa jest groźniejsza”, i zderzaliśmy się z drugą opinią „ej, ale to nie jest grypa!”. I wiecie co, chyba wszyscy mieliśmy racje. CoVID-19 nie jest grypą, ale grypa może być groźniejsza i nie, nie jesteśmy na nią lepiej przygotowani. Rzecz w tym, że z grypą jesteśmy oswojeni (bo co roku jest sezon na grypę), a po drugie na grypę mamy przecież szczepionki. Tylko że (i tu muszę znaleźć źródełko) ze skutecznością tych szczepionek może być różnie. Ważna uwaga - nie dołączam do grona antyszczepionkowców, nie próbuję twierdzić że szczepionki są złe, podnoszę tylko argumenty, zachęcające do sprawdzenia efektywności szczepionek na grypę, bo tu możemy się mocno zdziwić (ja się zdziwiłem, spodziewając się skuteczności porównywalnej do tego, jak radzi sobie np. szczepionka na ospę, czyniąc te chorobę niemal nieistniejącą).

Co też ciekawego mnie złapało w tym tygodniu\n\n1.  Początki mierzenia się z prokrastynację nie są łatwe. Na razie jestem na etapie zwiększania własnej świadomości co mi czas kradnie i jak bardzo nie umiem sobie z tym poradzić. Potrzebuję determinacji do tego, żeby zamykać głowę na czas i nie pozwalać jej uciekać za bardzo. Będzie ćwiczone. Bez paniki. Krok po kroku. Trzeba się pilnować. I wyłączyć powiadomienia większości aplikacji. Nic osobistego, po prostu krzycząc odwracają uwagę. Niepotrzebnie. Niby już poograniczałem, ale nie dość.  [[wit o prokrastynacji]]\n2.  Pierwszy kontakt z metodą Pomodoro (ustaw sobie okresy 25 minut na pracę + 5 minut przerwy) zaskakująco… przyjemne. I zdaje się efektywne. I… mam nadzieję, coś z tego będzie. Korzystam z aplikacji „Be Focused” ( [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/be-focused-focus-timer/id973134470](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/be-focused-focus-timer/id973134470) ) - łatwa, prosta, wygodna. No cholera chyba się polubimy. [[wit o prokrastynacji]],[[aplikacje]],[[pomodoro]]\n3.  Łatwiej mi było z metodą Pomodoro w domu (home office) niż w biurze. Troszkę dlatego, że łatwiej było się wyłączyć na określony czas od bodźców. Siedząc za firmowym biurkiem zdarzało się nie raz, że ktoś podszedł, podpytał, wytrącił z tego w czym w danym momencie byłem głową. Muszę nauczyć się mówić „przepraszam, za moment”. To w sumie coś, o czym pisano w „one second ahead” - to Ty decydujesz, kiedy i komu poświęcisz swoją uwagę. Naucz się świadomie odmawiać. [[wit o prokrastynacji]], [[pomodoro]] \n4.  Ostatnia myśl związana z [[Pomodoro]]… Tu jak w medytacji. Od czasu do czasu, coś sprawi, że Twoje skupienie związane z oddechem i niemyśleniem o niczym zostanie przerwane i pomkniesz uwagą za jakimś mniej lub bardziej ważnym skojarzeniem. Właśnie wtedy powinieneś „gently, but firmly” sprowadzić uwagę do tego, na czym Ty chcesz ją skupić. Bez krytyki, bez żalu, ale z pewnym wysiłkiem wrócić głową w miejsce, w którym w danym momencie chcesz ją mieć. I to samo zauważam przy pracowym rozproszeniu. Moje rozwiązanie? Zauważam, a następnie wykonuje pewien wysiłek aby wrócić na chciane tory. Ćwiczymy. Pierwsze efekty są malutkie, ale dają nadzieję. [[wit o świadomym korzystaniu]]   \n5.  Just Jammin Gramatika ([wspominałem w zeszłym tygodniu](https://niecodzienny.net/2020/01/czy-w-2020-bede-pisal-wiecej-moze/)) zapętlony w tle nadal się sprawdza. Zobaczymy jak długo. Nie chciałbym sobie obrzydzić tego kawałka. [[muzyka]]\n6.  Finowie udostępnili darmowy kurs o podstawach sztucznej inteligencji. Brzmi interesująco, chyba się skusze. [https://www.elementsofai.com/](https://www.elementsofai.com/)  [[czego chciałbym się nauczyć]]\n7.  Cytat, który zwrócił moją uwagę: „Point of view is worth 80 IQ points” - Alan Key, z książki The Everything Store. [[cytat]], [[książkii]], [[dziwadełka]]\n8.  Ze specjalną dedykacja dla pana Prezydenta Kochanego naszego „Jeśli jesteś pochodzenia europejskiego albo azjatyckiego, istnieje duża szansa, w przedziale od jednego do czterech procent, ze masz neandertalskie DNA” - Ludzie, krótka historia o tym, jak spieprzylismy wszystko, Tom Philips. I równocześnie dygresja... im więcej czytasz, tym więcej masz treści, do której możesz się odnieść. Swoją droga, im więcej czytasz, tym częściej trafiasz na podobne argumenty (co sprawia ze a - może jednak tych argumentów jest skończona ilość, b - jest szansa ze lepiej je zapamiętasz). Tym razem o roli kotwiczenia w percepcji rzeczywistości (por. [[Choice Factory]]). [[książki]]\n9.  Droga rzeczywistości, podpowiadacz mi te książkę - [[Thinking Fast and slow]] - trzeci raz w ciągu miesiąca. Tak, obiecuje przeczytać, ale proszę, bądź bardziej subtelna.

Może i wygodne, ale średnio efektywne. [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n12.  Na listę książek do przeczytania, a może raczej do sprawdzenia czy na te listę trafi pozycja [[David Epstein]] - Range, why generalists triumph in specialised world. Wszystko na podstawie wspomnianej rozmowy na Recode Decode. Ale większa pokusa jest tez sprawdzenie co ten człowiek. napisał, bo mówi bardzo ciekawie. [[książki]]\n13.  Od kilku tygodni jestem posiadaczem AirPodsów. Wszystko dlatego, że kolejne Earpodsy postanowiły zakończyć (albo prawie zakończyć) swój żywot, losowo puszczając muzykę / podcast kiedy nie miałem na to ochoty. Na moje (absolutnie) niewymagające ucho, słuchawki od [[Apple]] robią robotę - dźwięk, jakość wykonanie, cena - wszytko gra. Dlatego postanowiłem spróbować wersji bezkabelkowej. Wrażenia… są tak samo wygodne, ładowanie (dzięki case’owi) nie stanowi problemu, trzeba uważać, bo potrafią wypaść z ucha w najmniej spodziewanym momencie, mikrofon chyba zbiera zbyt dużo dźwięków z otoczenia, ale też może to być konsekwencja tego, że lubię słuchać na jednym uchu… O ile w zamkniętej, cichej przestrzeni nie ma z tym problemów, o tyle na ulicy to rozwiązanie się nie sprawdza. Muszę przekonać się czy używanie obu słuchawek rozwiązuje ten problem. [[gadżety]]\n14.  Druga uwaga do Airpodsów - zapomniałem jak wygodne jest korzystanie z pilota na słuchawkach - bez sięgania do telefonu zmiana głośności, szybkie przewijanie (reklam w podcastach). No cóż, tego AirPods (gen1) nie oferują. Ale można to robić via Siri. Tylko czy ja chcę / umiem / polubię podgłaśnianie przez Siri… Trzeba się będzie przekonać. [[Apple]], [[gadżety]]\n15.  W ramach ciekawostek, a zdaje sie mało kto o tym wie, zachęcam do podglądnięcia \"ważnych miejsc\" jakie w ramach danych lokalizacyjnych gromadzi iOS (Ustawienia -\u003e prywatność -\u003e usługi lokalizacji -\u003e usługi systemowe -\u003e ważne miejsca). Można sobie całkiem sporo powspominać. Ciekawe czemu ukryli to tak głęboko... i tak, można to zdezaktywować. Albo przynamniej poczuć się lepiej nie widząc, że te dane są gromadzone. [[Apple]], [[prywatność]]\n16.  I w sumie jeszcze jedna dziwna refleksja o iOSie i „mądrości” tego systemu. Słownik - działa spoko, o ile zrobisz jedną literówkę w słowie. Zrobisz dwie i dokonuje się Panic kernel, czyli nie ma bata, aby podpowiedział co chciałeś napisać. Polska język trudna język. [[apple]], [[sztuczna nie całkiem inteligencja]]\n17.  Lubię [[Penn Jillette]]. Dawno temu wydawał mi się głośnym amerykańskim komikiem, który umie w iluzję. Potem okazało się, że jest świetnym amerykańskim iluzjonistą, umiejącym w humor. Potem okazało się, że jest sceptykiem, ateistą i że lubi zaszczepiać zdroworozsądkowe podejście do świata (poszukaj BullSh!t), a potem okazało się, że gość też świetnie pisze i „przez niego” [wywróci mi się cały sposób w jaki się odżywiam, zgubię i nie odzyskam (przez jak na razie 2 lata) ponad 10kg](https://niecodzienny.net/2017/12/13-rzeczy-ktorych-nigdy-sadzilem-ze-zrobie/). Więc, joke’s on me, i nadal lubię Penna Jillette. Kiedy więc okazało się, że [[Tim Ferriss]] (wobec którego jestem sceptyczny) [nagrał 2h rozmowę z nim](https://tim.blog/2020/01/09/penn-jillette/), wiedziałem, że będę musiał jej posłuchać. Jednym z początkowych wątków tej rozmowy jest prowadzenie dziennika (na które nie mam, nigdy nie miałem ochoty. Nie Codzienny w tytule jest tu pewnego rodzaju podpowiedzią. Aaaale, Penn opisał swój rytuał porannego pisania, który obejmuje także „codzienne czytanie historii, czyli tego co napisał rok, 10 lat temu i 20 lat temu”. I dopowiedział, że to trochę jak podróż w czasie i rozmawianie z samym sobą z przeszłości i... wiesz co chłopie, jak mało kto potrafisz złożyć obietnicę. Ostatnim razem kiedy to zrobiłeś, powiedziałeś że nic tak nie smakuje, jak gotowana kukurydza po monodiecie (uwierzyłem Ci, choć nie spróbowałem) i zmieniłeś moją dietę. Tym razem Ci się nie uda. Nie uda Ci się. [[eksperymenty]] \n18.  Swoją drogą, już raz przytaczałem na niecodziennym tekst z przed 10 lat. I, prawdę powiedziawszy, bez wstydu. A nawet z małą satysfakcją. Zarówno z treści jaki z formy. [[wit o swoim pisaniu]]\n19.  Jak już jesteśmy przy wypominkach, to tak wygląda tekst napisany mniej więcej 10 lat temu, bo w styczniu 2010. I z jakiegoś powodu jest tam otagowana Beata Kempa. Ta sama, która w tym tygodniu dała popis w Brukseli. No po prostu czad. [Uwłaczający spektakl, uwłaczający aktorzy](https://niecodzienny.net/2010/01/uwlaczajacy-spektakl-uwlaczajacy-aktorzy/) [[napisane przez Wita]]\n20.  Jeszcze jedna rzecz o wywiadzie Penna Jillette. Na koniec rozmowy z Ferrissem, pytany o to, co chciałby dodać, czy jest coś nad czym teraz się zastanawia, powiedział, że biorąc pod uwagę ilość hejtu jaki się wylewa zewsząd w sieci, i widząc że social media zamiast nas łączyć doprowadzają do coraz głębszych podziałów, i będąc przekonanym, że najlepsze są pokojowe rewolucje, zastanawia się, w jaki sposób możemy zejść z tej szkodliwej drogi. I ukuł zwrot, który stosuje, aby unikać podziałów na My i Oni. Podziałów, który jest szkodliwy i konfliktowy. Jilette interesował w szczególności podział na tych, którzy głosowali na Trumpa i na resztę. I pracuje nad tym, aby mówić „Those of us, who voted for Trump”. Genialne. Those of us. Genialne. Biorąc pod uwagę, że [język, którego używamy w polityce, ale w dowolnym innym aspekcie naszej rzeczywistości ma znaczenie](https://niecodzienny.net/2016/03/jezyk-a-polityka/), jest kurcze pod wielkim wrażeniem. Those of us.  [[Penn Jillette]], [[Tim Ferriss]], [[polityka]]\n21.  Anka przypomniała mi film z 9 dobrymi radami od pewnego Austarlijczyka dla młodych ludzi.   \n      [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoEezZD71sc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoEezZD71sc)  \n      I sam film znałem, to co mnie wytrąciło, to to, że zaczyna się od od słów - mając 37.9 lat, podzielę się z Wami swoimi obserwacjami. I tu dwa prztyczki w mój pyrkaty (zdaje się wciąż) nos. Po pierwsze, dobre ma te rady. Po drugie, nie wiem, czy ja potrafiłbym znaleźć swoje, tak dobre i tak dobrze podane 9 rad dla młodych. Niemała zazdrość. Duże uznanie. [[tim minchin]], [[jak żyć]]\n22.  Artykuł o serwisie OnlyFans, i jak zmienia się zarabianie na soft (a pewnie i hard) porno. [https://www.1843magazine.com/people/onlyfans-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-topless-creator](https://www.1843magazine.com/people/onlyfans-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-topless-creator) Z tego artykułu dwa cytaty  \n\u003e On any given day, 100m users visit porn sites owned by the company Mindgeek, such as Pornhub, RedTube and YouPorn. As with any industry in decline, as profits crumble, labour rights and pay are affected. Female performers may be paid £300 for a shoot, with another £100 thrown in for extra sex acts. As a result, performers are pushed into performing more hardcore scenes to make money.  \n    \n\u003eThis illusion of proximity is critical to OnlyFans’ appeal. “Hardcore porn is easy to come by, but a relationship with a girl is hard to get,” explains Andrew, a 42-year-old engineer from Sheffield. “But with OnlyFans you get it.” He’s been following Brooks since September 2018 and estimates he spends around £300 a month on her page. He believes that Brooks does care for him. “If I go quiet and don’t take part in things for a few days, she notices and will start messaging me and asking me how I am.” I ask Andrew if it feels like he and Brooks are in a relationship. He pauses. “It's difficult to define,” he says finally. “There are times when it feels like we almost are a couple.”\n[[porno]], [[praca]]\n23.

Opcja w której nie robię jednego i drugiego bo nie mam czasu na jedno i drugie jest sprytną wymówką, ale... no nie do końca z tym moim „nie mam czasu” tak to wygląda. Po prostu muszę powybierać na co czas poświęcam. [[zarządzanie czasem]], \n4.  W temacie czasu - seriale. To się chyba prosi o jakąś osobną notkę, ale seriali jest tyle, że ciężko się na któryś zdecydować... i całej masy seriali nie mam nawet głowy próbować. Do tego stopnia, że choć wiedźmińską sagę bardzo lubię, to jakoś nie mogę się przemóc żeby Wiedźmina oglądać. Pewnie dobrze by się było przełamać... nie wiem jeszcze kiedy. [[seriale]], [[wiedźmin]]\n5.  Łamigłówki - bardzo, bardzo lubię. Są takie, które mają rzekomo bardzo trudny poziom, i które jestem w stanie „ogarnąć” relatywnie szybko. Ale są takie, które... no zacinają mnie. W tym momencie są dwie takie „złośnice”: \n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/niecodzienny.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0934-scaled.jpg?fit=560%2C238\u0026ssl=1)\n\nJedna jest od niedawna, druga od chyba dwóch lat bezczelnie oporna. Nie poddajemy się. [[dziwadełka]]\n\n6.  Sięgnąłem po \"[[Pan raczy żartować, panie Feynman]]\". I tu taki cytat. \n\n\u003e „Jest coś niedobrego z ludźmi: nie uczą się przez zrozumienie, tylko jakoś inaczej, pewnie na pamięć. Ich wiedza jest taka krucha”\n[[książki]], [[jak myślą ludzie]], [[jak korzystać z wiedzy]], [[Richard Feynman]]\n\n7.  wydawało mi się, ze najgłupsze co można zrobić, to uczyć się do testów. Bardzo w punkt to spostrzeżenie Feynmana. Nie umiemy się uczyć. Paradoksalnie, nikt nas nie uczył. [Tu kilka podpowiedzi.](https://niecodzienny.net/2018/03/wlam-sie-do-mozgu/) [[napisane przez Wita]], [[jak korzystać z wiedzy]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Pan raczy żartować, panie Feynman]]\n8.  Feynman opisuje swoje doświadczenia ze świadomym śnieniem. Kilkanaście lat temu Bartek opowiadał mi o tym - o możliwości uświadomienia sobie we śnie, że się śni, i przejęcie świadomej kontroli nad wydarzeniami, jakie mają miejsce za zamkniętymi powiekami. Dodatkowo, ciekawą rzeczą jest świadome zasypianie - czyli skupienie się nad tym co pojawia się w naszej głowie przed zaśnięciem i przyglądnięcie się temu. Sprawdzam. [[Richard Feynman]], [[eksperymenty]], [[Pan raczy żartować, panie Feynman]]\n9.  „Pan raczy żartować, panie Feynman” - czytając te książkę czuje się głupi. Czasem nie rozumiem tego o czym autor pisze, czasem nie umiem sobie tego wyobrazić. Rzeczy które były dla niego oczywiste „za małolata” dla mnie są czarną magią. Zdarzają się fragmenty, które odbieram troszkę jak obcojęzyczny film. Nie znam szczegółów fabuły, ale staram się nadążyć za wątkami i nie zgubić się w głównym nurcie opowieści. A nadal jesteśmy przed projektem Manhattan.  [[książki]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Pan raczy żartować, panie Feynman]]\n10.  Podejście do Spotify nie wiem juz które. Skoro już apple nauczył mnie płacenia za subksrybcję i z mniejszym się to wiąże obrzydzeniem, to… Dajemy się przekonać Mateuszowi, który zachęca do zaprzyjaźnienia się ze  Spotify. Dlaczemu? Gdyż podobno doskonale podpowiada muzykę, czego Apple w zasadzie nie robi (a cała rozmowa zaczęła się od tego, że przeczytałem przytoczone przez [Michała Kreczmara badania dot UX platform vod](https://www.facebook.com/krecz/posts/10157776798360275)). No to sie przekonajmy. [[eksperymenty]], [[spotify]], [[subskrypcje]] \n11.  I jeszcze raz sięgam do Feynman'a i tu kolejne z jego spostrzeżeń: W zabawie nie chodzi o to, żeby wszystko wiedzieć. Ale warto próbować, próbować, próbować. Mam wrażenie ze z początkiem roku ludzie maja duża ochotę do eksperymentowania. Nie tylko ja, ale także obserwowani przeze mnie Bartek Pucek czy Ferris o eksperymentowaniu piszą. A może jest tak, ze zwracam na to uwagę tylko dlatego, że to także moje doświadczenie...[[eksperymenty]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Pan raczy żartować, panie Feynman]], [[jak korzystać z wiedzy]] \n12.  Nowy cykl w ramach tygodnika… a co też panie autorze pisałeś 10 lat temu.. Było coś? No cóż, było, między innymi:\n\t\t1.  [„Takie polskie…” – czyli jakie?](https://niecodzienny.net/2010/01/takie-polskie-czyli-jakie/)\n\t\t2. [W drodze do Hurghady](https://niecodzienny.net/2010/01/w-drodze-do-hurghada-dzien-i/)\n\t\t3.

Ekspozycja produktów w sklepie sportowym. O.o [https://hotelcreative.com/work/](https://hotelcreative.com/work/) robi wrażenie... jak nie lubię po sklepach chodzić i ni cholery się na dizajnie nie znam, to chylę czoła. [[dziwadełka]], [[Internety]]\n14. Uwaga do samego siebie. Jeśli czytasz swoją notkę i coś Ci w niej zgrzyta, to daj sobie chwilę, podejdź do niej jeszcze raz a potem popraw, żeby nie zgrzytało. [Ta o płaceniu gotówką](https://niecodzienny.net/2020/01/placic-tylko-gotowka-w-2020-roku/) na tym skorzystała. [[jak żyć]], [[napisane przez Wita]]\n15.  A w temacie gotówki.. w poniedziałek 100wa dosłownie mi wyparowała z portfela. Bez żadnych wielkich zakupów. Ale nie ma inflacji. [[pieniądze]]\n16.  Wreszcie, wiele lat po tym jak skończyły się czasy mojej ogólnokształcącej edukacji, sięgnąłem po [[Trans-Atlantyk]]. Wstyd mi, że tak późno. Już od przemowy czuć stylistyczny rozmach i bezkompromisowość autora. I mierzenie się z Polskością… Bronienie jej przed Polakami. I mierzenie się z tym, jak to jest przez prawdziwych Polaków odebrane. Ale najpiękniejsze i tak jest to, jak sobie autor z tym radzi, pokazując, jak bardzo wynika to z niezrozumienia. \n\n\u003e Ale na cóż mnie jakieś boje z umarłą Polską przedwojenną czy też z przebrzmiałym stylem dawniejszego patriotyzmu, gdy mam inne i bardziej uniwersalne kłopoty? Czyż traciłbym czas na te przeczasiałe drobiazgi? Jestem z tych ambitnych strzelców, którzy, jeśli pudłują, to tylko do grubszej zwierzyny.” \n[[Witold Gombrowicz]], [[książki]]\n\n17.  Sam zaś [[Trans-Atlantyk]] jest przerażająco „na czasie” po tylu, tylu latach. Nic się nie zmieniamy. [[książki]], [[Witold Gombrowicz]]\n18.  Bez przeglądarki na telefonie da się żyć. Zaskakująco. Odkąd zdecydowałem się na to ograniczenie (a to już trzy tygodnie) jedynie sporadycznie było to trudnością (choćby wtedy, kiedy chciałem synowi puścić coś na YouTube… aha, YouTube na telefonie też nie mam… ). A poza tym - mało co jest niezbędne do natychmiastowego sprawdzania. Da się z tym żyć;-) Czasem łapie się na myśli - a to bym sobie wskoczył na fb czy na tt i kiedy tego zrobić nie mogę, świat się nie wali. Ograniczam na telefonie nawet ilość maili, które sprawdzam, włącznie z tym, który przez jakiś czas był podstawowy. I... żyje się. Świat się nie wali. [[jak żyć]], [[eksperymenty]]\n19.  Po zabawie ziemniaczanej i zmianie diety wydawało mi się, że w tym temacie jestem twardym zawodnikiem. I cóż, wydawało mi się 😉 Usłyszałem - \"po powrocie z diety zapewne i tak zostnę na ograniczonym cukrze i zapewne bez kawy\". I ta myśl \"bez kawy\" zrobiła mi wow... Gotowość do odstawienia kawy, której nie uznaję za napój życia, robi na mnie wrażenie. I na takie rzeczy mogą się decydować tylko prawdziwie hardcorowi zawodnicy. Mam jeszcze dużo do nauki. [[eksperymenty]]  \n20.  Jakiś czas temu miałem styczność z aplikacją [Appointy](http://appointy.com/) . I wracam do moich obserwacji z tego zetknięcia, ponieważ po raz kolejny jestem pod ogromnym wrażeniem obsługi klienta. Jedyny rodzaj czatu, który pomagał, a nie przeszkadzał. Skupienie się na tym, jak można pomóc klientowi. To jest tak dobrze robione, że nawet popełniłem dla nich recenzję na google. I powtarzam jeszcze tu - niesamowita obsługa klienta. [[aplikacje]], [[obsługa klienta]] \n21.  Po pierwszych kilku dniach, coraz bardziej lubimy się ze [[Spotify]]. Najbardziej za to, że potrafi zaskoczyć. Na przykład [Progressive Electronic on the Late Night Highway](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX6GJXiuZRisr?si=YarDpR9nQACB-IbBtt8Xkw)… wooooaaaaa. I zupełnie nie brakuje Apple Music. \n22.  Kilka dni temu sięgnąłem po „[[Słońce i jej kwiaty]]” [[Rupi Kaur]], autorki „[[Mleko i miód]]”. Wit sięga po poezję… ale to przede wszystkim dlatego, że Rupi potrafi spisywać moje myśli i ubierać je w moje słowa. O ile „Mleko i miód” połknąłem nie raz na raz, o tyle „Słońce i jej kwiaty” zmusza mnie do pokory. Ilość emocji, ilość bólu, ilość krzywdy, którą autorka dzieli się z czytelnikiem sprawia, że mam czasem lęk przed przewracaniem kartki po kolejną cząstkę jej opowieści. Dużo ostrożniej czytam, dużo rozważniej. Zaskakująca lektura.

Cholera… przyjemnie w tej mojej nowej bańce 😀 Ale tak poza wszystkim, mocno wciągająca prezentacja. Raz po raz mam z niej krzyk - wow. O wow. \n\n![](https://i1.wp.com/niecodzienny.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ben_Evans_2020.png?fit=560%2C315\u0026ssl=1)\n\nJakie miałem te o Wow? \n\n-   - Smartfony dorosły, więc nie nie ma co oczekiwać spektakularnych zmian (bo jesteśmy na etapie korekt, a nie wymyślania). To moje osobiste wow, bo w dwóch slajdach gość zamyka mój pomysł na notkę „fetysz innowacyjności”.  \n-   - na ile to wszyscy inni uczą się stosować technologię w swoich dziedzinach, a na ile to technologia postanawia rozszerzyć swoją obecność w dziedzinach.\n-   - o tym jak rośnie ecommerce, ale ile ma jeszcze do urośnięcia. \n-   - o tym że wszystko idzie falami. \n-   - o tym, że nic nie jest tak nowe jak nam się wmawia 😉\n-   - o tym jak się zmieniają zachowania zakupowe ludzi\n-   - i jestem bardzo ciekaw kiedy reklama skuma, że musi wymyślić siebie na nowo, bo ludzie przestają mieć czas na oglądanie telewizji (ale nie na innego rodzaju rozrywkę).\n-   - także o tym, że USA już nie są największym rynkiem mobile, ani ecommerce, i że będziemy mieli więcej TikToków.\n\nCholernie ciekawa prezentacja. A Ben Evans trafia od razu na listę ludzi, których obserwuję i na których [[newsletter]] będę czekał. A do tego pisze bardzo ciekawe artykuły. [[jak działa świat]]\n\n2.  Tym czasem w Polsce, o Polsce [napisał Rafał Stec](https://rafalstec.blog/2020/01/24/jestesmy-w-dupie/):\n\n\u003e „Przywykliśmy, że media teoretycznie publiczne zdegenerowały się do plugawych propagandowych szczekaczek, które masakrują umysły dzień w dzień, więc niespecjalnie przejmujemy się także tym, że duże medium prywatne daje się przekupić politykom, proponuje im notoryczną uległość.” \n\nSwoją drogą, minął kolejny tydzień, WP ma się dobrze. To jest absolutnie niesamowite. Ludzie, pozwalacie się kłamać. Bez wazeliny.  [[polityka]], [[polska]], [[Rafał Stec]], [[wirtualna polska]]\n\n3.  Nie wierze w kuloodpornych na wszystko, więc przyjdzie i taki moment, kiedy zmiecie wszystko i wszystkich z obecnego rozdania. NIe mam na myśli rozdania dziennikarskiego, a rozdania politycznego. Mam tylko nadzieję, ze przyjdzie zanim trzeba będzie wszystko stawiać od nowa. Straszne jest tylko, czy to co czeka na nas za rogiem, będzie lepsze. Chciałbym. [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n4.  Czytamy dalej \"[[Pan raczy żartować, panie Feynman]]\" i dowiadujemy się, że pluton jest pierwiastkiem wytworzonym przez człowieka... ale kurde jak? To trzeba doczytać. [[książki]][[Richard Feynman]]\n5.  Jak się okazuje (opierając się wciąż na tej samej lekturze), nawet największe tajemnice strzeżone są kombinacją admin | admin i pochodnymi... Wnioski - oczywisty jest taki, że najsłabszym ogniwem większości zabezpieczeń jest człowiek. I że warto zachęcać do - unikalnych haseł i korzystania z menadżerów haseł. I Two Factor Authentication. A potem i tak się okaże, że jednak człowiek i socjotechnika - hasło domyślne, albo hasło zapisane na karteczce przyklejonej do klawiatury / szuflady, albo hasło oparte o datę. [[Richard Feynman]], [[Pan raczy żartować, panie Feynman]], [[jak myślą ludzie]]  \n6.  Feynman podpowiada też, że czasem wystarczy zapytać. O cokolwiek. O wszystko. W najgorszym razie, usłyszysz nie. Co jest po drugiej stronie strachu? Czasem wystarczy zapytać. [[Richard Feynman]], [[Pan raczy żartować, panie Feynman]], [[one more question]]\n7.  I jeszcze spostrzeżenie dotyczące tego, jak się uczymy. Nie tylko tego, że nie umiemy się uczyć, ale że nie można uczyć rysunku tak, jak się uczy fizyki, co wcale nie wypada korzystnie dla fizyki. Nie tylko nie umiemy się uczyć. Zdaje mi się, że z uczeniem innych też mamy kłopoty. [[Richard Feynman]], [[Pan raczy żartować, panie Feynman]], [[jak korzystać z wiedzy]]\n8.  [9 porad od seniorów](https://www.facebook.com/wheatlandmanor/posts/1434578523378380)…  Do mnie najbardziej przemawia \n\n![](https://i2.wp.com/niecodzienny.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Lola.jpg?fit=560%2C748\u0026ssl=1)\n\nA do Ciebie? [[jak żyć]], [[dziwadełka]], [[jak myślą ludzie]]\n\n9.  Ten Podcast robił furorę już w zeszłym roku. Sześcioodcinkowy reportaż kryminalny pt. [[Śledztwo Pisma]] ([https://open.spotify.com/episode/12NzslM1zVn1LHRdSwGoVf?si=5wHVHhPYRq2okTCdGubzLQ](https://open.spotify.com/episode/12NzslM1zVn1LHRdSwGoVf?si=5wHVHhPYRq2okTCdGubzLQ) ). Otwiera oczy z niedowierzania. I nawet jeśli słuchając mam trochę uwag „technicznych” do sposobu realizacji, to jednak tematyka, opowieść sprawia, że człowiek zostaje ze szczęką gdzieś na wysokości kostek. I zastanawia się, powielokroć, czy sam mógłby zostać bohaterem takiego reportażu… [[jak działa świat]]\n10.  Robert podpowiada Youtube’owy materiał tłumaczący zastosowanie AI. Jak już pisałem, mam do Google coraz większy dystans i robię się cholernie ostrożny wobec takich projektów, ale z drugiej strony muszę przyznać -   [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjq6DwYksrzz_fsWIpPcf6V7p2RNAneKc](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjq6DwYksrzz_fsWIpPcf6V7p2RNAneKc) \n11.  Takie dziwne pytanie mnie dopadło, kiedy kończyłem jeść słoik masła orzechowego... Nie, nie zjedzony na raz. ale skąd z kalorii kilogramy? Co, dlaczego, perche. No bo rzecz jasna znaczenie ma nie ilosć jedzonka, a treść jedzonka. Brawo Wit, jakże odkrywcze. Wszystko dlatego, że dotychczas nie musiałem temu poświęcać najmniejszej z myśli. To się zmienia. Przynajmniej na jakiś czas. Choćby na tydzień, w którym jednak będę liczył. Rekomendowana mi aplikacja - fitatu  / fatsecret. Hmm… Na ten moment skusiłem się na „My Fitness Pal” i uczymy się siebie. Jestem ciekawy, bo np. totalnie mnie zaskakuje ilość kalorii w bułce. Ale jak to że aż tyle. Ech, taka dzika nauka. [[eksperymenty]], [[co jesz jeżyku]]\n12.  Wracamy do wątku okienka żywieniowego - jemy wyłącznie w godzinach 7:30 (easy) - 18:30 (no nie wiem czy ogarnę czasowo). To o której jem wieczorem zależy wyłącznie od tego, ile czasu zajmie mi gotowanie obiadu. Odgrzewanie tego z wczoraj idzie szybciej (zaskoczenie). Ale jestem strasznie wolnym kuchcikiem. [[co jesz jeżyku]], [[intermittent fasting]]\n13.  Niecodzienny na głos dostał polecenie. Totalnie niespodziewane.

I że to może być trochę bardziej efektywny sposób? I że w różnych regionach wykorzystuje się różne pałeczki?

W kwestii skąd czerpiemy wiedzę o świecie. Na przykładzie [[Koronawirus]], czyli choroba, która pojawiła się w Chinach i szybko przykuła uwagę mediów na całym świecie. Łatwo wpaść w panikę, dobrze wiedzieć co się dzieje i komu wierzyć. Na ten przykład podczytywać tu: [https://www.theguardian.com/science/coronavirus](https://www.theguardian.com/science/coronavirus) [[jak działa świat]]\n16.  Wierzę w mailing, [już o tym pisałem](https://niecodzienny.net/2014/11/czy-spamerzy-walcza-ze-spamem-dlaczego-musza-byc-lebscy-goscie/). To nawet nie chodzi o kreatywność, a o skuteczność tego narzędzia i to że nie jest ono takie „sexy” jak wszystko co można zrobić w Internecie. Jestem też trochę świrem [jeśli chodzi o pisanie i jak to robić dobrze](https://niecodzienny.net/2016/04/dobrze-pisac-krocej/). I zwracam uwagę na to, jak tworzyć skuteczne mailingi. I w sumie ważne są dwie rzeczy. Po pierwsze, pamietać o szacunku dla odbiorcy i mieć na uwadze jego czas. Rozwiązaniem jest stosować proste zasady - krótko, na temat, z oczekiwaną akcją. Po drugie, od każdej zasady są wyjątki i czasem dłuższa forma też może się sprawdzić, pod warunkiem że jest uzasadniona. Że jest wypełniona treścią a nie literkami zbitymi w słowa. Co mnie tchnęło do tej refleksji - propozycja tego, jak wygląda szablon przygotowany przez [[Amazon]]. Jestem dziwny, ale zachwycają mnie takie rzeczy. Uczmy się ich. [[newsletter]]\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/niecodzienny.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AWS.jpg?fit=560%2C1001\u0026ssl=1)\n\n17.  Dużo bardziej podoba mi się to, jak się mnie uczy [[Spotify]] [niż to jak sie mnie uczył TikTok](https://niecodzienny.net/2020/01/tik-tok-i-zawod-przyszlosci/). To wszystko jednak kwestia odpowiednio zrobionej kanapki - poczytaj [[SIła Nawyku]] i to jak promuje się przeboje radiowe. I jeszcze w temacie Spotify - Niecodzienny na głos jest też już na Spotify. A co 😉Aczkolwiek Podcasty na Spotify są dla mnie niezrozumiałe, ale to dlatego, że ja chcę szukać podcastów nie po polsku. I tu jest ciut mniej wygodnie. \n18.  Ponieważ jestem freakiem finansów osobistych, kiedy gdzieś pojawia się test „o finansach”, to ja chcę go zrobić. WIęc tu jest: [https://financialengines.com/financial-literacy-quiz](https://financialengines.com/financial-literacy-quiz) i jedno z pytań brzmi - jeśli wziąłeś pożyczkę na kwotę 20 tysięcy dolarów na 20% / rocznie (drakoński procent, swoją drogą) to jaką kwotę musisz oddać po 4 latach, jeśli nie spłaciłeś żadnych odsetek. Od razu poszedłem w obliczenia i karnie liczę te swoje domniemane odsetki, w pierwszym roku robi się 24, drugim 28,8, w trzecim 34,56, w czwartym 41, 472. Zaznaczamy odpowiedź powyżej 40 tysięcy. Brawo ja. Czy to dobra odpowiedź? Tak, dobra, ale haczyk jest gdzie indziej. Dowolna kwota przy 20% odsetek podwaja się w ciągu mniej więcej 3.5 roku. Magia procentu składanego. Za każdym razem wali mnie prosto w twarz. Miejcie baczenie na każdy mały procencik. [[pieniądze]], [[food for thought]]\n19.  Jeszcze z tego testu - jakiej wysokości wydatków związanych z kosztami medycznymi może się spodziewać małżeństwo przechodzące na emeryturę w wieku 65 lat przez cały czas trwania emerytury? 266k$; No… ta kwota bije w głowę. [[pieniądze]], [[co to będzie]]\n20.  Rapowanie „z głowy”, jako przykład mindfulness.

[[Dzienniki więzienne]] - jakże różny styl pisania od opowiadań czy powieści. Hmm.. oddzielamy autora od dzieła. [[Jeoffrey Archer]] \n8.  Dzienniki - choc nie tu po raz pierwszy o tym słyszę - kiedy masz nawet średnio pomysłowych ludzi, którzy maja nadmiar czasu do wymyślania (24h, więźniowie) nie oczekuj, ze wszystkie ich pomysły będą łatwe do wychwycenia przez najmądrzejszych nawet funkcjonariuszy (mniej czasu, mniejsza determinacja). [[jak działa świat]], [[Dzienniki więzienne]], [[Jeoffrey Archer]]\n9.  Ostatnie słowo o dziennikach - Archer nie jest przeciętnym więźniem i jego doświadczenia więzienne również nie są powszednie. Jasne, wszyscy wokół chcieli pokazać, że nikt się z nim nie cacka, a równocześnie sami więźniowie roztoczyli nad nim całkiem spory parasol... dzięki temu, że on był znany, znali go wszyscy których dobrze znać i pomagali mu zmierzyć się z zupełnie nieznaną mu rzeczywistością. [[jak działa świat]], [[Jeoffrey Archer]]\n10.  Do sprawdzenia - The basement room Graham Green - zachwala tak bardzo Archer, że aż warto się skusić. [[rzeczy do rozważenia]]\n11.  Mniejsza dostępność do sieci oznacza rzadziej sprawdzane maile, oznacza zaległości względem newsletterow na które jestem zapisany. Rok 2020 a ja mam zaległości w mailngach. Albo ja jestem stary, albo Internet lubi czasem zjeść własny ogon. Smacznego. [[newsletter]], [[jak działa świat]]\n12. Słowo o urlopie... od bodaj 10. roku życia jeżdżę na nartach. Dotychczas chyba dwukrotnie próbowałem stawać na desce i zawsze okazywało się to kiepskim pomysłem. Tym razem się uparłem. Codziennie, przez cztery dni stawałem na desce przez około 1,5h. Pokornie. Ze świadomością tego, że to będzie bolesne doświadczenie. Ze świadomością braku jakichkolwiek umiejętności. Grzecznie stawiałem pierwsze kroki na oślej łączce, uczyłem się czasem boleśnie jak się to ustrojstwo je. Mądrzej byłoby wziąć instruktora, ale... uparty jestem, jak osioł. W efekcie tych wszystkich zabiegów czwartego dnia zjechałem z większej górki (górka mała, trasa ma około 1km) coś 10 razy. Kości całe, zęby w komplecie, siniaków uniknąłem. Ten PESEL jeszcze daje radę. Fajnie jest nie umieć. Fajnie jest się uczyć. [[eksperymenty]], \n13. Zaskoczyło mnie też, że kiedy straciłem pewność swoich umiejętności na stoku, zauważyłem dużo więcej lekkomyślności innych narciarzo/snowboardzistów. Pewna maniera „jestem królem stoku”, która nie przeszkadzała mi chwilę wcześniej (kiedy byłem jednym z królów), była źródłem obaw, kiedy stałem się jednym z najsłabszych uczestników zabawy. Na całe szczęście stok był prawie pusty. Mam nadzieję, że to spostrzeżenie sprawi, że będę trochę bardziej czujny i lepiej rozumiejący zachowanie i potrzeby innych na stoku, kiedy znów będę stawał na dwóch deskach.

Muszę się wczytać w regulaminy, ale to by było prawdziwie przewrotne;) [[pieniądze]]\n15. Niezależnie od posiadanej poduszki finansowej, zatory przelewów przychodzących prowadzą do dyskomfortu, zwłaszcza gdy wszystkie płatności są już poplanowane i nie mam ochoty przerzucać na innych niesolidności tych, na których przelew czekam.

A tak całkiem serio, bez ochoty na nakręcanie spirali paniki i szerzenie dezinformacji… Niestety, patrząc na to, jak toczy się polska rzeczywistość, temat POLEXITu zwany też WYPIERPOL zaczyna być oswajany. Mam postulat, przy całej ułomności Europy, nie mamy lepszej alternatywy. Nie, nie poradzimy sobie sami. Już teraz jesteśmy w trudnej pozycji, a bez Europy będzie jeszcze gorzej. Dopuszczanie do rozważania o wyjściu z UE jest moim zdaniem szkodliwe i powinniśmy to zatrzymać, zęby nie obudzić się jak Wielka Brytania. Mały pro tip. Nie jesteśmy Wielką Brytanią. Nie jesteśmy wyspą, nie mamy takiego dziedzictwa, nie mamy takiego majątku. Nasza historia pokazuje, że kiedy zostawić nas samych, to przestajemy istnieć. Więc, wydaje mi się, że  trzeba za każdym razem kiedy ktoś mówi „nie będzie nikt nam mówił jak mamy rządzić się w swoim domu” trzeba stawiać opór. W przeciwnym razie, sprowadzamy się do bezwolnego i maltretowanego dziecka lub partnera w chorym domu. Wszyscy wokół to widzą. Może wreszcie i my zobaczymy?

W coraz ciekawszych czasach żyjemy 😉 [[pieniądze]], [[jak działa świat]]\n9. [[Dzienniki więzienne]] Jeffreya Archera - przeczytane. Archer, skazany, jak sam twierdzi, za niewinność. Przesadnie srogi wyrok. Na celowniku polityczno mediowym. A równocześnie sądy dwukrotnie podtrzymywały wyrok, jak sam podkreśla, stronniczego sędziego. Taka mieszanka. [[Jeffrey Archer]]\n10. Dzienniki - miałem ochotę rzucić to w pewnym momencie w cholerę (gdzieś tak w 80% książki) bo… trochę przestało cokolwiek wnosić. Natomiast na całe szczęście nie rzuciłem, bo nagle nie tyle pojawił się, ile bardzo wzmocnił wątek narkotyków i ich penalizacji. Nie mam w tej kwestii zdania, może poza jednym - robimy coś fundamentalnie źle w tej sprawie, bo (i tu opierając się o dane przytaczane przez Archera) zamiast doprowadzać do zmniejszenia problemu, on narasta. I zamiast zatrzymywać się w obszarze miękkich narkotyków, zgodnie z polityką zero tolerance, doprowadzamy do tego, że ludzie sięgają po coraz mocniejsze rzeczy. Zło. [[Dzienniki więzienne]], [[Jeffrey Archer]], [[jak działa świat]]\n11.  Równocześnie w Stanach świadomi są problemu i coraz śmielej mówią o tym, że trzeba potraktować epidemię narkotykową jak rozprzestrzenianie się wirusa HIV. Zobaczyć chorych a nie wykluczonych. Trudna rzecz. Zero tolerancję łatwiejsze. Tylko nie działa. [[jak działa świat]] \n12. [[Mały Książę]] - przeczytane kolejny raz i jest to zdecydowanie nie dla dzieci. I choć zawiera kilka znakomitych obserwacji, to cała historia jest dla mnie mniej zrozumiała.

Kilka dni temu na FB pisałem tak:\n\nto jest prośba o 1% z Waszych PITów, ale zacznę od podziękowań. Jeśli juz wiecie komu przekażecie swój cenny jeden procent, to przede wszystkim dzięki, że to robicie. Wasze pieniądze już niosą pomoc.  🙌🏻\n\nJeśli natomiast jeszcze nie wiecie komu przekażecie setną część swojego podatku - proszę wesprzyjcie Iwonę, która od polowy zeszłego roku dzielnie walczy o powrót do samodzielności po operacji, która sparaliżowała ją od pasa w dół.

[[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n\nTo teraz wracamy zrobić szybki przegląd zapisków i skojarzeń z tego, co też mi się w tym tygodniu w oczy rzuciło.\n\n1.  Siła nawyku. Lubimy piosenki, które znamy i lubimy rozwiązania, które działają. Nie jest łatwo robić coś inaczej, nawet najprostsze rzeczy, jak choćby myć zęby drugą ręką. SIła komfortu i przyzwyczajenia do aplikacji bywa tak duża, że żeby nie wiem jak dobra była nowa aplikacja, opór i pewne wymaganie żeby się jej nauczyć może być tak duży, że nie jest warty próbowania (bo może zaburzyć coś co już stosujemy i temu zaszkodzić). Więc… nie zawsze warto próbować za wszelką cenę.   \n      \n    Do czego piję? Do robienia notatek. Próbowałem różnych form i narzędzi, i to co dotychczas sprawdzało mi się najlepiej, to były notatki Apple’owskie. Czemu?\n    -   Bo są dostępne na wszystkich moich urządzeniach w zasadzie równocześnie \n    -   Bo mają wsparcie od systemu (macOS / iOS) z którego korzystam\n    -   Bo mam je zawsze pod ręką\n    -   Bo były pierwszymi które zadziałały tak, jak chciałem\n    -   Bo pozwalają na gromadzenie ich w folderach, bo są pewne „tricki” które ułatwiają poruszanie się w ich gąszczu.\n    -   Bo są minimalistyczne i proste [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]]\n2.  No to co mi w tym przeszkadza? Cóż, jakiś czas temu odkryłem na YouTube [sympatycznego pana doktora](https://www.youtube.com/user/Sepharoth64), który tłumaczy jak poprawia swoją efektywność i jak bardzo jest zachwycony [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=09ffec06323d4b68a0191a2c4ebccdaf) (jeśli skorzystasz z tego linku, i postanowisz założyć konto na Notion, to ja dostanę od tego \"finders fee\"... chciałem żeby to było dla Ciebie jasne) Podszedłem pierwszy raz - jak pies do jeża. Podszedłem drugi - znowu się kłujemy. Była nawet taka myśl - weź to porzuć. Masz swój system, co kombinujesz, jeszcze spaprzesz (patrz punkt pierwszy). A potem druga - no właśnie o to chodzi, o spróbowanie zmierzenia się z tym dyskomfortem. No więc się mierzę 🙂 Co prawda ta notka jeszcze powstaje w Notatkach, ale przymierzam się do zrobienia w Notion. Po pierwszym zgrzycie, zobaczyłem światełko w tunelu, ba nawet okazało się, że to może być przyjemne. Stay tuned. [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]], [[aplikacje]]\n3. Słowo o YouTube. To co się wydarza na karcie na czasie, jest krzywdzące. Jest uwłaczające. Jest smutne. Myślę YouTube, że w tej kwestii robisz to źle. I nie interesuje mnie że to ludzie głosują. To znajdź tych ludzi i im wytłumacz. Ludzie, trzymajmy poziom, nie oglądajmy syfu. [[jak działa świat]]\n4.  A swoją drogą, w kwestii nieprzewidywalności YouTube'a - jak sądzicie, ile osób mogło chcieć obejrzeć ponad 3.5 godzinny film będący zapisem relacji live (żadnego skandalu, żadnego teledysku)? Cóż.. [dużo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YSnIuOjolU) 😉 A najciekawsze jest zobaczenie tego filmu [w kontekście](https://www.youtube.com/user/LidlPolskaPL/videos?view=0\u0026sort=p\u0026flow=grid); I nie, za tym filmem nie stoi żadna promocja;-) [[jak działa świat]], [[marketing]]\n5.  Szybka myśl - nie tęsknię do TikToka. Nie tęsknię też do Safari w telefonie. [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]]\n6. Jeszcze słowo o fucku (patrz [[Tygodniówka 6.2020 - Tydzień możliwie spokojny, ale za to czwartek na wkurzeniu]]. Każdy kto fucka pokazuje myśli, ze to takie złowieszcze, jesteś taki Super Villain, a ten gest rzekomo tak „doskonale wyraża jego wyższość”. Kiedy oglądasz cudzy środkowy palec, to wyglada to w najlepszym razie infantylnie. A oglądając to z boku, wygląda po prostu żenująco. [[opis obyczajów]]\n7.  When Worlds collide. Czytam „[[Dobra strategia, zła strategia]]” (tak, wciąż) oraz „The everything Store” o Amazonie. Byłem przekonany, że [[Amazon]] najpierw był księgarnią a potem się rozwinął w to, czym jest obecnie. Wychodzi jednak na to, że od samego początku (w głowie twórcy) był sklepem ze wszystkim, ale zaczął od bycia księgarnią, bo gdzieś trzeba zacząć a ciężki zaczyna się od wszystkiego. Wiec.. strategia „everything” była od początku, tylko potrzebowała czasu i zasobów, aby ja zrealizować. [[w poszukiwaniu efektywności]]\n8. Bezos miał powiedzieć „i thought we don’t make money when we sell things. We make money when we help customers make purchase decisions.” Delikatna zmiana perspektywy, stawia Cię w zupełnie innym miejscu względem klienta i konkurencji. [[w poszukiwaniu efektywności]], [[Jeff Bezos]], [[Amazon]]\n9.  A swoją drogą, [[Amazon]] nie zarabia tyle na handlu, ile zarabia na oferowaniu rozwiązań w chmurze. Co się dzieje w tej ekonomii to ja nie wiem. [[pieniądze]], [[w poszukiwaniu efektywności]] \n10.  Pisanie dziennika podnosi czujność czytania / obserwowania. Często rzeczy które widzę / czytam okraszone są skojarzeniem - dodawać do tygodniówki, czy nie… Wciąż jeszcze nie robię „preselekcji” treści… może powinienem. [[wit o świadomym korzystaniu]] \n11.  Czytając książki zaczynam korzystać z kindle'owych \"highlights\" żeby potem móc łatwiej się dzielić tym, co mi się warte do podzielenia wydało.

W sumie dość podobne było podejście Bezosa (i jego oczekiwanie) wobec pierwszych pracowników Amazonu - pracuj dobrze, ciężko i mądrze, wszystko inne poza Twoją pracą nie ma znaczenia. Mam mieszane uczucia. Bo z jednej strony chcę pracy, w której się mogę zakręcić tak bardzo nad jakiś zadaniem, że będę umiał oddać mu i swoje serducho i swój czas. Ale to nie oznacza, że każda praca tak będzie funkcjonować. Nie oznacza to też, że każdy w każdej pracy tak musi funkcjonować. I tak, wiem, w USA żyje się, by pracować, w Europie pracuje się by żyć, natomiast… jakoś zgrzyta mi oczekiwania pracodawcy, który mówi „Moja firma jest najważniejszym aspektem Twojego życia”.

Choć może powinienem czytać to inaczej. Niezależnie od tego co robisz, chodzi o to, żeby działało i służyło firmie. Żeby firma na tym korzystała. Mów - wszyscy chcemy słuchać.

Podejrzewam, że część z Was zna też taki wykresik - co zmienia robienie czegoś codziennie, i nawet minimalna codzienna poprawa, a co się dzięje, kiedy tylko troszeczkę każdego dnia tracimy: \n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/niecodzienny.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1-BETTER-EVERY-DAY.jpg?fit=560%2C492\u0026ssl=1)\n\nJest tutaj jedno przekłamanie - wraz z 1 procentem rośnie nie tylko korzyść, ale i wartość 1%, więc z czasem może być trudniej go codziennie dokładać. Poza tym, inaczej wygląda dokładanie 1% gdy umiesz 1%, a inaczej, gdy próbujesz dodać 1% do 90%... ale nie komplikujmy ładnej teorii 😉[[w poszukiwaniu efektywności]], [[jak działa świat]]\n\n16.

Jakiś czas temu, po sieci śmigał poprawiony dzięki AI i sieciom neuronowym pierwszy film Braci Lemierre (czyli pierwszy film wszystkich).  Ale kilka dni temu opublikowany został też poprawiony film z księżyca. I to też jest wow. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9nFrnCK60\n\nTam jest cholernie dużo piachu, na tym księżycu 😀 Zapewne nie zwróciłbym na to uwagi, gdyby nie to, że w \"[[Dobra strategia, zła strategia]]\" jest wyraźnie pokazane, że dla inżynierów misji Apollo dość istotne było, na jakim podłożu przyjdzie im lądować. Aby nie utknąć w impasie decyzyjnym trzeba było przyjąć jakieś założenia, wybrali \"krajobraz mniej więcej pustynny\". Wychodzi na to, że trafili.

Swoją drogą, współczesna ładowarka do dwóch telefonów i laptopa ma porównywalną moc obliczeniową, co komputer odpowiedzialny za dostarczenie misji na Księżyc, wylądowanie, wystartowanie i sprowadzenie ludzi na miejsce. Ładowarka. tu źródełko: [Ładowarki, a komputer pokładowy Apollo 11](https://forrestheller.com/Apollo-11-Computer-vs-USB-C-chargers.html). Nie pytajcie mnie, po co ładowarce komputer.

W tym tygodniu przypomniałem sobie o tym jaka jest definicja [polskiego przyjaciela](https://matadornetwork.com/life/12-differences-normal-friend-polish-friend/), w szczególności\n\n\u003e A normal friend emails you and Facebooks you regularly if you’re living away.\n\u003e \n\u003e A Polish friend won’t email you for 8 months, but next time you see each other, you will pick up right where you left off.\n\nCzasem te 8 miesięcy to blisko 20 lat i nawet jeśli przyjaciel jest słowem troszkę na wyrost, to jednak jest dużą przyjemnością poczuć w głowie \"śmiało, możesz gadać, jesteś wśród swoich\".

Ale dla mnie już nie bardzo jest, niestety, wiec [zżymam się z deklaracyjną rzeczywistością](https://niecodzienny.net/2020/02/na-macos-e-deklaracji-pit-za-2019-rok-nie-zlozysz/), zamiast grzecznie wydrukować i wysłać zeznanie pocztą... [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]] \n2. Koronawirus. Do momentu kiedy opublikuję tę notkę (a ten punkt piszę we środę) będziemy już mieli potwierdzony przypadek korona wirusa Covid-19 w Polsce. Panika zacznie się nakręcać. To tak dla nadania kontekstu: [[Koronawirus]]\n\n\t-   W 2019 roku w Polsce zginęło ponad 2 tysiące osób na drogach, co oznacza prawie 180 osób miesięcznie, co oznacza 6 osób dziennie. Ale tak, to Coronavirus jest grożny.  \n    Źródło: [https://www.fakt.pl/pieniadze/motoryzacja/smiertelne-wypadki-na-polskich-drogach-kto-ich-powoduje-najwiecej/](https://www.fakt.pl/pieniadze/motoryzacja/smiertelne-wypadki-na-polskich-drogach-kto-ich-powoduje-najwiecej/)\n\t-   Zastanawia mnie, jak długo będziemy uważać za kluczowe, że przypadku tego wirusa nie potwierdzamy w PL. Czy to cokolwiek zmienia? Czy zmienia nasze przygotowanie? Czy możemy być zieloną wyspą? A może jest tak, że jeszcze nie znaleźliśmy tego przypadku? A może lepiej nie mówić, ze znaleźliśmy, bo tak jest wygodniej? Bo ciut mniej siejemy paniką?\n\t-   Tu są codziennie aktualizowane dane na temat koronawirusa [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)\n\t-   Tu podsumowanie wiedzy o CoronaWirusie, w tym to, co jest najważniejsze - czym wyróżnia się na tle innych chorób, w szczególności grypy:\n\n\u003e **Why is this worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts?**\n\u003e \n\u003e We don’t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won’t know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2% in the epicentre of the outbreak, Hubei province, and less than that elsewhere. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about [400,000 deaths](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6815659/) each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.\n\u003e \n\u003e [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-coronavirus-symptoms-wuhan-china-pandemic-spread-covid-19](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-coronavirus-symptoms-wuhan-china-pandemic-spread-covid-19)none\n\n\u003e Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. \n\u003e \n\u003e [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-coronavirus-symptoms-wuhan-china-pandemic-spread-covid-19](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-coronavirus-symptoms-wuhan-china-pandemic-spread-covid-19)none\n\n\u003e Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.\n\u003e \n\u003e [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-coronavirus-symptoms-wuhan-china-pandemic-spread-covid-19](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-coronavirus-symptoms-wuhan-china-pandemic-spread-covid-19)none\n\n- I jeszcze 8 porad od [[Rafał Agnieszczak]] \n\n\thttps://www.facebook.com/ragni.net/posts/2992598947457597\n\n3.  Uczę się pisać szybciej na klawiaturze. Co prawda nie jestem dzięciołem, ale też nie piszę wykorzystując wszystkich palców, co jest.. jeśli nie irytujące, to mało efektywne..   \n    Nauka pisania na klawiaturze jest też dość karkołomna - gdyż to walka ze swoimi przyzwyczajeniami. Niestety, na 10fastfingers o których wspominałem nie ma dobrego modelu uczenia się, dlatego właśnie rozpoznajemy się z [https://www.ratatype.com](https://www.ratatype.com/).  \n    Jakie to jest dziwne, wiedzieć gdzie są które klawisze i uczyć się na nowo pisać. Przedziwne.I teraz teoria teorią, ćwiczenia ćwiczeniami, a kiedy przychodzi co do czego, to wracam do starych nawyków... to będzie dłuższa zabawa;) [[Wit się uczy]], [[eksperymenty]]\n4.  Gdybym pisał swoje notatki w zeszłym roku, na 99% zamieściłbym tu rekomendację obejrzenia serialu Czarnobyl ze stajni HBO. Dziś zachęcam do posłuchania serii podcastów towarzyszących temu serialowi.

Doskonale to widać w rozmowie [Baracka z Davidem Lettermanem](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80209188?trackId=14277283\u0026tctx=0%2C0%2Cd83e976c-e648-49b2-9b81-c6004de8ea43-76221870%2C%2C) (do zobaczenia na Netflixie), ale też w tym jak Obama prezentował się choćby na corocznym spotkaniu z prasą[:](https://youtu.be/6OQAHcB72dg)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6OQAHcB72dg [[opis obyczajów]]\n\n6.

Okazją do publikacji tego filmu jest zbliżający światowy dzień kobiet. A dla mnie to pretekst do przypomnienia najlepszej (in my not so humble opiniom) realizacji: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3ApQ2H6zFs [[marketing]]\n\n8.  Ale w tym temacie mam jeszcze jedno, mocne znalezisko \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZM57oTu9Ng [[feminizm]], [[sztuka]]\n\n Hmm... czy już jestem feministą?

W temacie estetyki i sztuki, nie wierzę ze to mówię, ale jest taka wystawa [Impresjoniści 3d](http://impresjonisci3d.pl/). To wystawa, która zaskakuje. Z jednej strony zaskakuje bardzo skromną formą. To jedynie 60 obrazów na sztalugach poustawianych jedno obok drugiego. Mało to spektakularne. Potem jeszcze dostajesz do oglądania okularki czerwono niebieskie jak z taniej gazetki, więc oczekiwania nie mogą rosnąć. Wreszcie stajesz przed tymi obrazami i... wymiękasz.  \n\t- Wymiękasz, bo nagle zderzasz się z impresjonistami, którzy wciągają Cię w swój świat. Wiesz że patrzysz na obraz, a masz wrażenie, że patrzysz na projekcję. Tak przedstawione obrazy mistrzów zmuszają Cię do skupienia, do obserwacji, do bycia tu i teraz. Zapominasz o tym gdzie jesteś, zapominasz o ludziach, którzy wokół Ciebie, zapominasz o wszystkich rozpraszających cię bodźcach z zewnątrz i chłoniesz. Chłoniesz portrety, morze, pejzaże, ogrody.  \n\t- Bardzo polecam odwiedzenie tej wystawy. Będzie jeszcze w Gdańsku i w Warszawie.\n\n[[rekomendacja]], [[sztuka]]\n11.  Jakie to jest dziwne... słuchanie tego, czego ktoś próbował \n\nhttps://youtu.be/kRr9LQ7mZ_A\n\ni łapanie się na tym, jak wielu rzeczy z tego o czym on mówi sam próbowałem... I jak wiele z tych prób trwa... No ja nie wymiękłem po 30 dniach zimnych pryszniców. [Robię to od ponad dwóch lat i śmiem twierdzić robię to ciut mniej jak lama](https://niecodzienny.net/2018/05/dlaczego-biore-zimne-prysznice/) 😉 [[dziwadełka]], \n\n12.  W moim ekosystemie pojawiła się aplikacja do oddychania. Więc okazuje się, że możemy stosować inny oddech na rozbudzenie się, inny oddech na zasypianie. Oddychanie ma znaczenie. Oddychać też nas nikt nie uczył, ale najwyższa pora poćwiczyć.  [https://www.oakmeditation.com](https://www.oakmeditation.com/)\n13.  Zasada 60/30. Wszystko zaczęło się od tego, że Bartek Pucek zrobił ankietę o swoim newsletterze, do której ja chciałem coś jeszcze dodać, a potem się okazało ze Bartek ma swoją stronę, na której ma [książki, które poleca](https://pucek.com/ksiazki/)( oeeeesssu ile dobrego czytania przede mną) i ma też swoje \"[Principles](https://pucek.com/pryncypia/)\".   \n    Punkt 22 (oby nie był to paragraf 22) tychże Principles brzmi - Eksploruj i próbuj nowego. Stosuj zasadę 60/30.   \n      \n    Co to jest zasada 60/30? Otóż - przez najbliższe 30 dni poświęć codziennie 60 minut dla siebie.Poświęć / zainwestuj czas w to, co dla Ciebie ważne. Nie czekaj. Nie odkładaj. Nie będzie lepszego czasu jutro. 60 minut dziennie, przez 30 dni. Bądź dla siebie ważny.\n14.  To jest wkurzające. Zamiast grać, oglądać, robić nic mam niby poświęcić czas dla siebie.. Równocześnie, mogę poświęcić czas dla siebie, zamiast oddawać go grze, serialowi albo TyTubo. Fuck.\n15.  W tym tygodniu skończyłem czytać [Good strategy Bad strategy Richarda Rumelta](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-difference-matters-ebook/). Już o tej książce pisałem. Jeszcze będę o niej pisał. Świetna pozycja, przynajmniej z mojego punktu widzenia. Powinienem był ją przeczytać wcześniej. Jakieś dwa lata wcześniej. Byłbym lepszym strategiem. Albo spokojniejszym strategiem.   \n    Od czasu do czasu polecam książki, polecam takie, które powinni przeczytać wszyscy, i tę książkę też powinni przeczytać wszyscy wanna be stratedzy. [[Dobra strategia, zła strategia]], [[rekomendacja]]\n16.  Co też sobie w tej książce zaznaczyłem? Choćby to: [[Dobra strategia, zła strategia]]\n\n\u003e Treating strategy like a problem in deduction assumes that anything worth knowing is already known - that only computation is required. A good strategy is, in the end, a hypothesis about what will work. Not a wild theory, but an educated judgment.\n\u003e \n\u003e Good Strategy, Bad strategynone\n\n\u003e If you fail to identify and analyze the obstacles, you don’t have a strategy. Instead, you have either a stretch goal, a budget, or a list of things you wish would happen.\n\u003e \n\u003e Good Strategy, Bad strategynone\n\n\u003e Importantly, opportunities, challenges, and changes don’t come along in nice annual packages. \n\u003e \n\u003e Good Strategy, Bad strategynone\n\n\u003e The need for true strategy work is episodic, not necessarily annual.\n\u003e \n\u003e Good Strategy, Bad strategynone\n\n\u003e “Without action, the world would still be an idea.”\n\u003e \n\u003e Good Strategy, Bad strategynone\n\n17.  I jeszcze uwaga do samego siebie 😉   \n    **_\"When we do come up with an idea, we tend to spend most of our effort justifying it rather than questioning it.\"_**  \n    Wicie... nie przestawaj pytać, także samego siebie. [[wit o świadomym korzystaniu]]\n18.  Rumelt wspomina o analizowania potencjału danego biznesu w oparciu o Pięć Sił Portera:\n    -   Na ile unikalnych jest produkt\n    -   Na ile klienci mają opcję negocjowania ceny\n    -   Na ile dostawcy mają wpływ na negocjowanie ceny\n    -   Jaka jest konkurencja\n    -   Jak duże jest ryzyko pojawienia się konkurencji -\n\nI odpowiedź na te pięć kryteriów pozwala ocenić i kondycję i potencjał biznesu. Nie żeby to była bardzo pogłębiona analiza, ale może służyć za dobry punkt wyjścia i wskazanie ewentualnych problemów i słabości. [[Dobra strategia, zła strategia]], [[w poszukiwaniu efektywności]]\n\nŹródełko: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter's_five_forces_analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter's_five_forces_analysis%5D(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter's_five_forces_analysis)\n\n19.  Swoją drogą, czytając przytoczonego wyżej Rumelta, albo wcześniej sięgając po Feynmana wydaje się tak oczywiście prosta i na wyciągnięcie ręki możliwość współpracy z największymi tuzami światowego biznesu czy polityki. Tu pojawia się uwaga Scotta Gallowaya - to kwestia umiejętności i pracy, ale też szczęścia i odwagi rodziców. Rodziców, którzy będą mieli odwagę przenieść się w tę część świata gdzie \"dzieje się\" i szczęścia aby móc trafić w te właśnie odpowiednie miejsca. A potem czytamy o tym książki.[[jak działa świat]], [[ile waży szczęście]]\n20. Myśl pod rozkminę. Kiedy następnym razem będziesz przygotowywał jakąś strategię, spróbuj ją potem przedstawić w formie, która będzie zrozumiała dla 5 latka. Czy jesteś w stanie w prosty sposób wydobyć z niej to, co najważniejsze i przekazać w sposób zrozumiały? [[upraszczanie]]\n21.  Chyba tego nie mówiłem, ale cholernie lubię dostawać rekomendacje. Czy raczej dostawać polecenia od innych tego, co uważają za warte mojego czasu. W tym tygodniu Tomek podpowiedział mi:\n\n\u003e Mam sugestię książkową do punktu 18 - George McKeown \"[Essentialism - The disciplined pursuit of less](https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown-ebook/dp/B00HELB6XI/)\". W temat minimalizmu/esencjalizmu wkręciłem się jakiś czas temu dostrzegając jak bardzo rozciągam się pomiędzy x tematów zamiast wybrać 2-3 istotne.\n\nTo o czym napisał Tomek wpisuje się jakże trafnie w niedawno czytane rzeczy. Jest bliskie zasad ograniczenia prokastynacji, wybraniu priorytetów w procesie planowania, istoty skupienia się na wybranych elementach strategii. Rozpoznam i pewnie wrócę do tego. [[food for thought]]\n\n21.  Dobre rzeczy przychodzą do cierpliwych. W kontekście spotu BurgerKinga - Moldy \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSDC4C3_16Y\n\nmam do dodania tylko jeden cytat od czlowieka, który za nią odpowiada:\n\n\u003e “‘Moldy Whopper’ is an idea that we had on the table for the past three years,” he said. “We had to wait until the products were clean so that we could do it.”\n\u003e \n\u003e Fernando Machado, warc.comnone\n\nCzekanie trzech lat na to, aby produkt był gotowy do kampanii reklamowej. Trzeba mieć cojones. Trzeba wierzyć w siłę koncepcji. I to jest koncepcja, która wykracza dalece poza komunikację. \"Bo wiesz, mamy taki pomysł na kampanię, ale do tego trzeba pozmieniać wszystko w tym jak przygotowujemy nasz produkt.\"  \n  \n\"Ok, robimy to.\"\n[[marketing]]\n23.  Znowu zmieniam mój pomysł na kawę, a dokładniej na to, jaką kawę piję. Odszedłem od kaw rozpuszczalnych, odszedłem od kaw mlecznych, odszedłem od kaw słodzonych. [Nawet zacząłem kupować kawę ziarnistą i dbać o dobrą kawę w domu](https://niecodzienny.net/2016/02/ile-kosztuje-kawa/). Teraz odchodzę od kaw z mlekiem roślinnym i sięgam po espresso. Najchętniej podwójne. Bez dodatków. Tylko teraz muszę znaleźć to ziarno, które będzie najsmaczniejsze. [[eksperymenty]], [[co jesz jeżyku]]\n24.  Z zupełnie innego świata. Jak wszyscy wiemy są na świecie rzeczy ważne, ważniejsze i jest też piłka nożna. A w piłce nożnej jest też Jose Mourinho, który wszedł do szatni Tottenhamu i... stała się magia. Odżył on, odżył klub, kibice go pokochali. No ale powiedzcie mi, jak nie pokochać trenera, który tak reaguje na konferencji prasowej... [[piłka nożna]]\n\nhttps://youtu.be/q0lU43cBuMI\n\n25.  Zapewniałem, że będę się z tą aplikacją oswajał, stąd zaznaczam, że ta notka powstała w [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=09ffec06323d4b68a0191a2c4ebccdaf)*. Chyba się polubimy;-).

Nie mniej jednak, całą koncepcję można sprowadzić do \"żeby robić biznes, trzeba mówić do ludzi\", a także \"żeby robić dobry biznes, trzeba mówić do ludzi i dostarczać im wartość\". Bardzo chcę, żeby to właśnie tak działało. [[porozmawiajmy o wartościach]], [[ninja selling]], [[książki]], [[w poszukiwaniu efektywności]]\n2. O samej książce zapewne więcej będzie za tydzień, ale dziś jeszcze jeden kontekst, który ma znaczenie zanim zaczniemy myśleć o sprzedaży (czy czymkolwiek czym się akurat chcemy zajmować). Wiele w codzienności zależy od naszego nastawienia (dlatego [warto się dobrze nastrajać](https://niecodzienny.net/2018/01/slowa-maja-moc-zacznij-sie-dostrajac/)), a jedna z podpowiedzi brzmi - pamiętaj, aby codziennie rano okazać wdzięczność wobec świata. Bądź wdzięczny, bądź pokorny. Potem ruszaj w świat i zdobywaj go. Potrzebowałem chwili żeby znaleźć mój powód do wdzięczności. [[wit o świadomym korzystaniu]], [[ninja selling]]\n3. Jestem wdzięczny za wolność, niezależność. Za to, że nie ciąży mi kredyt, za to że nikt nie ma nade mną władzy i kontroli. Za to, że mogę dość spokojnie patrzeć w przyszłość. Że ta wolność jest niezwykłą dla mnie wartością. Piszę to (i powtarzam to sobie rankiem) z pewną ostrożnością, nie chcąc zapeszyć, nie chcąc sprowokować losu do pokazania mi gdzie moje miejsce. Ja wiem gdzie moje miejsce i wiem, że wszystko co mam jest nic nie warte, kiedy przyjdzie się zmierzyć z Poważnym Problemem. Nie próbuję z niego drwić ani go wywoływać. Ale uświadomienie sobie tej wolności, daje mi dużo, tym bardziej że... [[wit o planowaniu]], [[wit o świadomym korzystaniu]]\n4.  No cóż, po raz kolejny w swoim życiu zaczynam \"the in-between moment\". No wiecie, ten moment gdy to co trwało dotychczas już się kończy, a to co ma jeszcze być, dopiero nadejdzie.  \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/JoeGordonLevitt/videos/1145778445445818/\n[[the in-between moment]], \n5.  To jest znów ten moment, kiedy przychodzi do mnie kolejny [Egzamin w szkole latania](https://niecodzienny.net/2017/09/egzamin-szkole-latania/). Po dwóch latach od [lądowania w Poznaniu](https://niecodzienny.net/2018/01/attention-please-podchodze-ladowania/), przyszedł czas pożegnać miasto koziołków. Robię krok w nieznane, będąc równocześnie przekonanym że nie jest to krok wstecz. Poznałem tu wyjątkowych ludzi, nauczyłem się nowych rzeczy, przyczyniłem się do zdobycia dwóch fajnych marketingowych nagród i [zepsułem TyTubo](https://niecodzienny.net/2020/02/gromadz-wiedze-zatrzymaj-panike/). Not bad 😉 [[wit o sobie]]\n6.  Specjalnie dla Pawła, który zna się na żartach, a [którego możecie oglądać na YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCh6xRQIXWXNL5tVrMVsJGQ), przyszła kolej na garść statystyk. W ostatnich dwóch latach trasę Kraków Poznań lub z powrotem przemierzyłem w sumie 160 razy, robiąc ponad 73tysiące kilometrów, spędzając tak zdecydowanie za dużo czasu. Ale byłem grzeczny, cierpliwy, wyrozumiały gdyż #kochamPKP. [[wit o sobie]] \n7.  Na pożegnanie się z agencją zobaczyłem na tablicy taką definicję:\n\n\u003e Strateg i Mediowiec to tacy akanci, tylko że jeden jest od kontaktowania się z rzeczywistością, a drugi z technologią.\n\u003e \n\u003e Karolinanone\n\nI myślę sobie... to ładne co [Karolina](https://twitter.com/sennicka) wymyśliła. Ale zdolni kopyrajterzy tak mają. Potrafią kondensować. \n\n8.  W ostatnich dniach mojej agencyjnej rzeczywistości przyszło mi do głowy pytanie - Wit, czym dla Ciebie jest dobra reklama? Czy to:\n    1.  Przekaz z pierwiastkiem boskim, który ludzie raz widząc, zapamiętują i potrafią przytoczyć, czy\n    2.  Komunikat, który wsparty odpowiednio dobrym budżetem zostanie z ludźmi przez powtórzenie i wmłotkowanie im tego do głów. [[marketing]], [[w poszukiwaniu efektywności]], [[wit o rzeczywistości]]\n9.  Dla mnie, to zawsze była bramka numer 1. Wierzyłem w to, że komunikat \u003e powtórzenie. A mądrzejsi ode mnie (Arek, Piotr) mówili - Wit, przyjdą inni i zasypią Cię, a raczej Twoje wymyślne kreacje milionami monet jak tylko będą chcieli. Że dobry komunikat to wisienka na torcie mediowym. Nie wierzyłem. Potrzebowałem lat, żeby tego doświadczyć i nadal nie mogę się z tym pogodzić. Pogodzić z tym, że komunikat (zwłaszcza reklamowy), który ma większą siłę i znaczenie od budżetu, to cholerny czarny łabędź. A istotą czarnego łabędzia jest to, że jest rzadki. Tak rzadki, że prawie niewystępujący w przyrodzie.. [[wit o rzeczywistości]], [[marketing]], [[w poszukiwaniu efektywności]]\n10.  Tylko, że ja widziałem czarnego łabędzia. I wciąż wierzę, że zobaczę kolejne. O naiwności. [[wit o rzeczywistości]], [[w poszukiwaniu efektywności]]\n11.  O zarządzaniu czasem. Kiedy zaczynasz dzień od sprawdzenia skrzynki odbiorczej, pozwalasz, aby cudze problemy organizowały Twój dzień. Masz do wyboru - podporządkować swój dzień pod swoją agendę, albo żyć i mierzyć się z agendami innych. Mój problem polega na tym, że nie mam agendy, więc pozwalam na to, aby cudza agenda planowała mi rzeczywistość. To nie jest dobre. [[zarządzanie czasem]]\n12.  Wracam do pomodoro. To wymaga pewnej celowości. Więc wracam. Bo sobie poszedłem, zapomniałem, zapuściłem. Zatem jeszcze raz. Zacznijmy powoli. Zróbmy sobie w najbliższym tygodniu przynajmniej jedno zadanie w tym modelu. Przekonajmy się. [[wit o prokrastynacji]]\n13.  Dlaczego jedno zadanie? żeby nie spalić. Się. Żeby nie było zajarania, które kończy się w popiołach. Nawyki buduje się cierpliwością i małymi kroczkami, a nie radykalną zmianą (radykalna zmiana zachowania może się wydarzyć, kiedy dzieje się radykalna zmiana otoczenia, resztę nawyków budujemy ostrożnie i cierpliwie). [[wita zmagania z rzeczywistością]], [[w poszukiwaniu efektywności]]\n14.  O newsletterach. Już o tym pisałem, że wierzę w to, że właśnie przeżywają renesans. Że po zachłyśnięciu się sołszalami, zaczniemy doceniać (zapewne nie wszyscy) wartość w newsletterze. Także dlatego, że newsletter nie podlega kaprysowi żadnego algorytmu, tylko naszego świadomego działania. Widzę, coraz bardziej, że doceniam dobre newslettery. Że pilnuję, aby ich czytać. Ze muszę pilnować, aby mnie nie zasypały. Ale... to jest właśnie [moje źródło wiedzy](https://niecodzienny.net/2020/01/tik-tok-i-zawod-przyszlosci/). Natomiast widzę po sobie, że w ostatnich tygodniach otworzyłem się na więcej treści w ten sposób dostarczanej. I dobrze mi z tym. [[newsletter]]\n15.  Newslettery potrafią być źródłem wiedzy także niespodziewanej. Wspominałem o tym, że chcę liczyć kalorie (przestałem, poległem). Ale zapisując się do aplikacji, zapisałem się także (bez celowości, a już na pewno bez przekonania że będę z tego korzystał) do newslettera MyFitnessPall. Choć z aplikacji juz nie korzystam, stała się rzecz dziwna i zacząłem zauważać i czytać newslettery, które do mnie przesyłali. Bo miały dobry tytuł. Bo zawierały ciekawe artykuły. Bo trafiały w moją ciekawość. [[newsletter]]\n16.  Kluczem w dostarczaniu treści, jest - podobnie jak w sprzedaży nieruchomości w USA 😀 - dostarczanie wartości dodanej. Wartość dodana jest chciana, nawet jeśli newsletter jest nie chciany. Był niechciany, przyniósł wartość, stał się chciany. Bez nagabywania. Po prostu przynosząc odpowiedź na pytania, które mnie zaintrygują. [[newsletter]]\n17.  Jakie pytania? Te o pomysły na śniadania - proszę, [10 pomysłów na śniadania do przygotowania](https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/10-make-ahead-breakfasts-under-300-calories/), albo to, kiedy nie umiem sobie w głowie poukładać, jak duże znaczenie ma nie tyle to, ile jedzenie waży, na ile jest objętościowe, a to ile ma kalorii. Zwyczajnie moja głowa nie do końca ogarnia tego, jak zdradziecka może być garść (albo dwie) orzechów. Tu jest mała podpowiedź: [https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/7-portion-size-mistakes-youre-probably-making/](https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/7-portion-size-mistakes-youre-probably-making/) Nie znalazłbym tego, gdyby nie newsletter. Drzemie w nich siła, tylko trzeba trafiać z wartością do szukających wartości. Nie byle czym do wszystkich. Chyba że masz za dużo pieniędzy, wtedy patrz punkt 7. [[co jesz jeżyku]], [[newsletter]]\n18.  Dziwne pomysły. Tym razem od Ferrisa. A może tak, kiedy ktoś pyta Cię o \"to co robimy\", \"gdzie idziemy\", \"co jemy\", nie odpowiadać \"A na co masz ochotę\" tylko wyjść z inicjatywą i \"to może dzisiaj spróbujemy XXX\" czyli uczenia się wychodzenia z propozycją. Brzmi... niezwykle prosto. Wychodzić z inicjatywą. Biorę pod rozkminę. [[Tim Ferriss]], [[eksperymenty]], [[Food for thought]]\n19.  Jak to tiktok może człowieka zaskoczyć.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/E0-Sh-g0cgg\n\nAle czekaj, przecież to jest TyTubo a nie TikTok... No tak, ale wszedłem tam nie tylko dla legginsów, i nagle się okazało, ze jest tam Jessica Alba (nie rozumiem do końca po co) i jest tam Charlize Theron i ona ma chyba pomysł. No i opublikowała ten skecz. A ze jest śmieszny, to się nim dzielę. A Tiktoka (jako że oddaję telefon do firmy) na mojej komórce nie ma, to się chyba więcej nie spotkamy. Przynajmniej przez chwilę. [[dziwadełka]], [[Charlize Theron]]\n\n20.  Nie wiem jak to się dzieje, że tak dobrze nam wychodzi bycie obrzydliwymi. Nie rozumiem. Oczywiście, powinienem pamiętać aby nigdy, przenigdy nie czytać komentarzy w Internecie bo to jest zło. Tym razem się skusiłem i jest mi wstyd. \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/koscierzyna24info/videos/809337309545673/ \n[[opis obyczajów]]\n21.  Jacy my wszyscy jesteśmy mądrzy i idealni i wszystko potrafimy najlepiej. Wszyscy z partii ĘĄ. uech. [[opis obyczajów]]\n22.  Natomiast oczywiście że zawsze można liczyć na życzliwych. \n[wpis GUS na TT]([](https://twitter.com/GIS_gov/status/1235492077871472640)\n\nPrzecież to jakaś paranoja..\n\n23.  Aż nie wierzę, że to robię, bo mam z tym człowiekiem problem. Tak mi się przynajmniej dotychczas wydawało. Ale to pewnie dlatego, że oglądam świat i poznawałem go przez szkiełko telewizora. A on kurde kłamie (mam prawie 40 lat i wciąż na nowo zaskakuje mnie spostrzeżenie, że telewizja kłamie... czasem świadomie, a czasem nieświadomie przekłamuje... ). Może zatem przestanę... może zatem nauczę się wyrabiać zdanie przez poznanie, a nie przez podglądanie. No w każdym razie, podzielę się z Wami fajną, krótką historią miłosną.
